Recurring Billing and Electronic Notices

Effective December 17, 2009

Each month on your bill date, we will charge your method of payment: (a) in advance for your monthly service plan fee (covering the next succeeding month of service), plus associated taxes and surcharges; and (b) in arrears for (i) any usage and calls not covered by your plan rate and (ii) any late and/or suspension fees. In addition, upon termination of your service (for any reason), we immediately will charge your method of payment for any unbilled amounts and any disconnection fees (including any applicable Early Termination Fee or Restocking Fee, and/or any fee(s) for non-return of leased equipment) that may be due.

All notices will be sent electronically to the most recent email address on file.

You agree to promptly update your account information whenever your personal or billing information changes (including your street/mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number). If notices are sent by Clearwire to the last email address provided by you, you agree that we have provided effective notice to you, and you irrevocably waive any rights to assert any failure or inadequacy of notice.
