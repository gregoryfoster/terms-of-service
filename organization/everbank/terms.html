The Mobile Banking Services are separate and apart from any other charges that may be assessed by your wireless carrier for text messages sent to or received from EverBank.

<p></p>
<p>2. Provision of the Services. The Mobile Banking Services are provided by EverBank and not by any other third party.

You must provide source indication in any messages you send (e.g., mobile telephone number, "From" field in text message, etc.).</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Description of the Services. You may use your mobile telephone or similar mobile device (the "Mobile Device") to access the Mobile Banking Services to review the balances of your deposit accounts at EverBank (your "Accounts") and view limited transaction history information relating to your Accounts ("Account Review Services"). In addition, if your Mobile Device includes the ability to take photographs you may use the Mobile Banking Services to capture images of checks using your Mobile Device and then transmit those images to us to deposit the checks to your Accounts ("Mobile Deposit Services"). The details, terms and limitations applicable to these Mobile Banking Services are set forth in this Mobile Agreement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Mobile Software Application. We will make available a software application ("Application" or "App") that you can download, install and use to access the Mobile Banking Services using your Mobile Device. You are responsible for providing and maintaining the Mobile Device that is necessary for the Mobile Banking Service. Any equipment or software you obtain from a third party is at your sole discretion and must conform to our Mobile Banking Service specifications and requirements.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Your Mobile Device and Other Equipment. We assume no responsibility for the defects or incompatibility of any Mobile Devices, or other equipment that you use in connection with the Mobile Banking Service, even if we have previously approved their use. At our election, we may replace or repair the Application.

We assume no obligation to offer support services for, or upgrades to, the Application. You understand and agree that the Mobile Banking Services may not be accessible or may have limited utility over some mobile networks, such as while roaming. </p>
<p></p>
<p>6. Account Review Services. The Account Review Services are additional Online Banking Services subject to the Online Banking Service Agreement portion of your Account Agreement. All terms of your Online Banking Service Agreement that are not inconsistent with this Mobile Agreement apply to the Account Review Services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. Mobile Deposit Services. The Mobile Deposit Services are subject to and governed by the Online Check Deposit Services Agreement portion of your Account Agreement. All terms of your Online Check Deposit Services Agreement that are not inconsistent with this Mobile Agreement apply to the Mobile Deposit Services. The definition of "Scanner" as used in the Online Check Deposit Services Agreement will include the Mobile Device you use to transmit Check images. Without limiting the foregoing, you provide us all of the same representations with respect to each Check you transmit to us using your Mobile Device as you make when transmitting a Check using a Scanner that is not a Mobile Device.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7.1 Limits for Mobile Deposits. We reserve the right to impose limits on the dollar amount(s) and/or the number of Checks that you deposit using the Mobile Banking Service. These limits may be the same or different than the limits we will impose when you use the Online Check Deposit Service to make deposits using a Scanner that is not your Mobile Device.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7.2 Your Additional Representations. In addition to the representations and warranties that you provide to us in your Account Agreement, you represent and warrant that you will not submit files containing malicious code when using the Mobile Banking Services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7.3 Confirmations. We will provide you with an electronic confirmation at the end of each Check image transmission, confirming our receipt of your Check image and related information. This confirmation does not imply that the transmission was error free or complete. If you do not receive a confirmation, it may mean that we did not receive your transmission or that there was a problem with some of the information. Notwithstanding any confirmation by us of its receipt, we may reject the Check, with or without cause, and charge the amount credited back against any provisional credit to your Account.</p>
<p></p>
<p>8. Hours of Operation. The Mobile Banking Service can be utilized 24 hours a day, seven days a week, except when our system is unavailable due to needed maintenance or system outages. We are not responsible for the unavailability of the Mobile Banking Service or any damages that may result from its unavailability.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9. Changes in Terms. We have the right to modify or terminate this Mobile Banking Agreement at any time. When making changes, we will comply with all applicable legal notice requirements.

Once this Mobile Banking Agreement is terminated, we will not allow any additional transactions using the Mobile Banking Services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>10. Disclosure of Your Information. When you use the Mobile Banking Service, information concerning you and your transactions will be available to the Licensor that provides the software Application. You agree that the Licensor may access your information for the purposes of processing your Mobile Banking Services.</p>
<p>11. Touch ID and App Passcode.  If your Mobile Device is compatible, you may be given the option to log into the App using Touch ID and/or an App Passcode.  If you have enabled Touch ID on your Mobile Device, you may activate or deactivate this feature through the App’s settings and/or your Mobile Device’s settings; EverBank does not have access to your fingerprint/biometric data. Similarly, you may enable or disable the App Passcode at any time through the App settings. Your App Passcode is NOT related to your Mobile Device password/access code; EverBank does not have access to your Mobile Device password/access code.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You acknowledge that by enabling Touch ID, you will allow anyone who has a fingerprint/biometric data stored on your Mobile Device to access your Account(s) via the App. Please do not record a fingerprint/biometric data of others on your Mobile Device.  If you do, please make sure the others who have such data stored on your Mobile Device are joint accountholders on your Account(s), as they will be able to view and transact via the App.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Call EverBank immediately at 888-882-3837 if you believe your Mobile Device has been lost, stolen or compromised in any way or if an unauthorized person has obtained access to your fingerprint/biometric data, App Passcode, or any other credentials that might allow them to access your Account(s) without your permission.
