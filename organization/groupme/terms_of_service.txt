Terms of Service
Simply put: GroupMe, Inc. (collectively, "we" "us" or "GroupMe") is a group texting and conference calling service that lets you stay in touch with groups of people via mobile phones. GroupMe is currently provided as a free service. We appreciate responsible usage of the service and hope you enjoy it! By the way, if you don’t agree to the Terms of Service below, don’t use the Service!

TERMS OF SERVICE
The following terms and conditions govern all use of the GroupMe service including without limitation this website (www.groupme.com) (collectively the "Service"). The Service is offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein, including the provisions calling for arbitration of disputes that may arise out of use of the Service, and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, GroupMe’s Privacy Policy http://groupme.com/privacy) and procedures that may be published from time to time on this website by GroupMe (collectively, the "Terms").

AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND
Please read the Terms carefully before accessing or using the Service. By accessing or using any part of the Service, you agree to be bound by the Terms. If you do not agree to the Terms, then you may not access or use the Service. GroupMe may amend the Terms from time to time and will provide notice of any substantive changes on this website. Continued usage of the Service constitutes acceptance of the amended Terms.

ABILITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
The Service is available only to individuals who are at least 13 years old. By using the Service you represent that you are at least 13 years of age and otherwise able to enter into a valid and binding legal agreement and acknowledge that the Terms constitute a valid, binding agreement between you and us.

GROUPME SERVICE
The Service enables you to create unique groups with friends, coworkers, and other individuals and then allows you send messages to individuals you or others add to the group. Each unique group is given a ten digit telephone number. Sending SMS messages to the number sends the message to the entire group, while calling the unique phone number will result in a conference call to the entire group. Please note that any text messages sent to the unique number will be sent to every individual in the group, with the exception of commands (always prefaced with a "#").

GROUPME MESSAGES AND CONSENT
Consent to add group members. GroupMe makes it easy for you to add group members to your groups so that you can exchange messages with each other. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT TO US THAT EACH PERSON YOU ADD TO A GROUP HAS CONSENTED TO BE ADDED TO THE GROUP AND TO RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGES FROM YOU AND ANYONE ELSE IN THE GROUP.

Consent to receive periodic messages from GroupMe. As part of the Service, GroupMe sometimes causes administrative messages to be sent to members of the group. For example, upon adding a new member to a group, such new member will receive a welcome message, instructions on how to stop receiving messages, and information on how to avoid certain charges by downloading the GroupMe app. GroupMe also may inform group members who have not replied that they automatically will be removed from the group if they do not participate. GroupMe may send other administrative messages as well. BY SIGNING UP FOR THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGES FROM GROUPME, AND YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT EACH PERSON YOU ADD TO A GROUP HAS CONSENTED TO RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGES FROM GROUPME.

Stopping groupme messages. To permanently cease receiving text messages from any group, text STOP to any group or to the GroupMe shortcode (GROUP or 47687). GroupMe service can be resumed by texting RESUME to any group or the shortcode.

TEXT MESSAGING FEES
GroupMe does not charge a fee to use the Service, but any text messages sent and/or received are subject to standard text messaging rates. Additionally, text messages sent and/or received count towards a monthly quota as any other messages do. Any users, whether sending or receiving text messages with GroupMe, should be aware that standard text messaging rates may apply. Please be aware that texting charges can fluctuate internationally. Text messaging rates can normally be found by asking your provider. If you are using GroupMe internationally, please read our International SMS terms, available online here: http://groupme.com/t

We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by any user, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.

ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER: IMPORTANT PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
GENERAL:
You agree that, unless prohibited by applicable law, the parties to the Terms may elect to arbitrate - and require the other party to arbitrate - any claim arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement or the Service.   

IMPORTANT NOTICE AND LIMITATIONS:
If you or we elect to arbitrate a claim, neither you nor we will have the right to: (1) have a court or a jury decide the claim; (2) participate in a class action in court or in arbitration, either as a class representative or a class member; (3) act as a private attorney general in court or in arbitration; or (4) join or consolidate your claim(s) with claims of any other person or involving any other transaction.

STARTING AN ARBITRATION:
To start an arbitration, you or we must give written notice of an election to arbitrate. This notice may be given after a lawsuit has been filed and may be given in papers or motions in the lawsuit. If such a notice is given, the claim shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Provision and the consumer or other applicable rules of the American Arbitration Administration then in effect using a single arbitrator appointed by the American Arbitration Association and approved by you and us. For more information please see www.adr.org.  

NO CLASS ACTIONS:
Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, if you or we elect to arbitrate a claim, neither you nor we will have the right to: (1) participate in a class action in court or in arbitration, either as a class representative, class member or class opponent; (2) act as a private attorney general in court or in arbitration; or (3) join or consolidate your Claims with claims of any other person or involving any other transaction, and the arbitrator shall have no authority to conduct any such class, private attorney general or multiple-party proceeding.

Any arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient for you. If you cannot afford or otherwise do not want to pay the Administrator's or arbitrator's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver of fees from the Administrator, we will consider in good faith any request by you for us to bear the cost of those fees. We will pay for our own attorneys, experts and witnesses and will pay the reasonable fees and charges of your attorneys, experts and witnesses if you win the arbitration, as determined by the arbitrator.

For claims involving more than $100,000, any party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel appointed by the Administrator, which will reconsider anew any aspect of the initial award that is appealed. The panel’s decision will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. The costs of any appeal will be borne in accordance with the paragraph above captioned "Location And Costs."   

GOVERNING LAW:
