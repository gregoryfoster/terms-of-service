      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Notifications and Service Messages.</h4>
        <p> For purposes of service messages and notices about the Services to you, notice shall consist of an email from LinkedIn to an email address associated with your account, even if we have other contact information. You also agree that LinkedIn may communicate with you through your LinkedIn account or through other means including email, mobile number, telephone, or delivery services including the US Postal Service about your LinkedIn account or services associated with LinkedIn.

In addition, use of the Services through a mobile device may cause data to be displayed on and through your mobile device. By accessing the Services using a mobile device, you represent that to the extent you import any of your LinkedIn data to your mobile device that you have authority to share the transferred data with your mobile carrier or other access provider. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile account, you must promptly update your LinkedIn account information to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person that acquires your old number and failure to do so is your responsibility. You acknowledge you are responsible for all charges and necessary permissions related to accessing LinkedIn through your mobile access provider.

        <p> LinkedIn offers various forums and blogs such as LinkedIn Groups and Answers where you can post your observations and comments on designated topics. LinkedIn also enables sharing of information by allowing users to post updates, including links to news articles and other information to their profile. Ideas you post and information you share may be seen and used by other Users, and LinkedIn cannot guarantee that other Users will not use the ideas and information that you share on LinkedIn. Therefore, if you have an idea or information that you would like to keep confidential and/or don&rsquo;t want others to use, or that is subject to third party rights that may be infringed by your sharing it, do not post it to any LinkedIn group or elsewhere on LinkedIn. LINKEDIN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR A USER&rsquo;S MISUSE OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION YOU POST IN ANY LINKEDIN COMMUNITY FORUMS SUCH AS THE LINKEDIN BLOG, GROUPS OR ANSWERS. </p>
      </li>
      <li>

        <h4>Export Control.</h4>
        <p> Your use of LinkedIn services, including our software, is subject to export and re-export control laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations (&ldquo;EAR&rdquo;) maintained by the United States Department of Commerce and sanctions programs maintained by the Treasury Department&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control.

We reserve all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement, including, without limitation, title, ownership, intellectual property rights, and all other rights and interest in LinkedIn and all related items. </p>

      <li>
        <h4>Services Availability.</h4>

As a result, we allow you to access LinkedIn as it may exist and be available on any given day and have no other obligations, except as expressly stated in this Agreement. We may modify, replace, refuse access to, suspend or discontinue LinkedIn, partially or entirely, or change and modify prices for all or part of the Services in our sole discretion.

For avoidance of doubt, LinkedIn has no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content that you or other Users provide when using the Services. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Third Parties.</h4>
        <p> LinkedIn may include links to third party web sites (&ldquo;Third Party Sites&rdquo;) on <a href="/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom&urlhash=VSkZ">www.linkedin.com</a>, <a target="_blank" href="/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2F&urlhash=9Fnz">developer.linkedin.com</a>, and elsewhere. LinkedIn also enables Platform Developers to create applications (&ldquo;Platform Applications&rdquo;) that provide features and functionality using data and developer tools made available by LinkedIn.</p>
        <p> You are responsible for evaluating whether you want to access or use a Third Party Site or Platform Application. You should review any applicable terms and/or privacy policy of a Third Party Site or Platform Application before using it or sharing any information with it, because you may give the operator permission to use your information in ways we would not. </p>
        <p> LinkedIn is not responsible for and does not endorse any features, content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from Third Party Sites. LinkedIn also does not screen, audit, or endorse Platform Applications. Accordingly, if you decide to access Third Party Sites or use Platform Applications, you do so at your own risk and agree that your use of any Platform Application is on an &ldquo;as-is&rdquo; basis without any warranty as to the Platform Developer&rsquo;s actions, and that this Agreement does not apply to your use of any Third Party Site or Developer Application. </p>
        <p> Please note: If you allow an Platform Application or Third Party Site to authenticate to or connect with your LinkedIn account, that application or website can access information on LinkedIn related to you and your connections. </p>
        <p> For additional information regarding Platform Developers and Platform Applications, please refer to LinkedIn&rsquo;s <a href="/static?key=privacy_policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h4>Disclosure of User Information.</h4>
        <p> You acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose your registration and any other information you provide if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary in our opinion to: (1) comply with legal process, including but not limited to civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties, whether or not the third party is a User, individual, or government agency; (4) respond to customer service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of LinkedIn, our Users or the public. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Connections and Interactions with other Users.</h4>
        <p> You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. LinkedIn may limit the number of connections you may have to other Users and may, in certain circumstances, prohibit you from contacting other Users through use of the Services or otherwise limit your use of the Services. LinkedIn reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other members and to restrict, suspend, or close your account if LinkedIn determines, in our sole discretion, that doing so is necessary to enforce this Agreement. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>DISCLAIMER.</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>SOME COUNTRIES AND JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED TERMS IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS AND AS A RESULT THE CONTENTS OF THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</strong> </p>
    <p> DO NOT RELY ON LINKEDIN, ANY INFORMATION THEREIN, OR ITS CONTINUATION. WE PROVIDE THE PLATFORM FOR LINKEDIN AND ALL INFORMATION AND SERVICES ON AN &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; AND &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; BASIS. WE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY EXPRESS WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS. </p>
    <p> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, WE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

ANY MATERIAL, SERVICE, OR TECHNOLOGY DESCRIBED OR USED ON THE WEBSITE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OWNED BY THIRD PARTIES WHO HAVE LICENSED SUCH MATERIAL TO US, SERVICE, OR TECHNOLOGY. </p>
    <p> LINKEDIN DOES NOT HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSONS SUBSCRIBING TO ITS SERVICES, NOR DOES IT HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO MONITOR THE USE OF ITS SERVICES BY OTHER USERS OF THE COMMUNITY; THEREFORE, LINKEDIN DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR IDENTITY THEFT OR ANY OTHER MISUSE OF YOUR IDENTITY OR INFORMATION. </p>
    <p> LINKEDIN DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICES IT PROVIDES WILL FUNCTION WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR ERRORS IN FUNCTIONING. IN PARTICULAR, THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICES MAY BE INTERRUPTED DUE TO MAINTENANCE, UPDATES, OR SYSTEM OR NETWORK FAILURES. LINKEDIN DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY ANY SUCH INTERRUPTION OR ERRORS IN FUNCTIONING. FURTHERMORE, LINKEDIN DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY MALFUNCTIONING, IMPOSSIBILITY OF ACCESS, OR POOR USE CONDITIONS OF THE LINKEDIN SITE DUE TO INAPPROPRIATE EQUIPMENT, DISTURBANCES RELATED TO INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, TO THE SATURATION OF THE INTERNET NETWORK, AND FOR ANY OTHER REASON. </p>

  <li>
    <h3>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>SOME COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS AND AS A RESULT THE CONTENTS OF THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</strong> </p>
    <p> Neither LinkedIn nor any of our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, employees, shareholders, or directors (&ldquo;LinkedIn Affiliates&rdquo;) shall be liable for (a) any damages in excess of five times the most recent monthly fee that you paid for a Premium Service, if any, or US $100, whichever amount is greater, or (b) any special, incidental, indirect, punitive or consequential damages or loss of use, profit, revenue or data to you or any third person arising from your use of the Service, any platform applications or any of the content or other materials on, accessed through or downloaded from LinkedIn. This limitation of liability shall: </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
      <li>Apply regardless of whether (1) you base your claim on contract, tort, statute or any other legal theory, (2) we knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages, or (3) the limited remedies provided in this section fail of their essential purpose; and</li>
      <li>Not apply to any damage that LinkedIn may cause you intentionally or knowingly in violation of this Agreement or applicable law, or as otherwise mandated by applicable law that cannot be disclaimed from in this Agreement.</li>
      <li>Not apply if you have entered into a separate agreement to purchase Premium Services with a separate Limitation of Liability provision that supersedes this section in relation to those Premium Services.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>TERMINATION.</h3>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
      <li>
        <h4>Mutual rights of termination.</h4>
        <p> You may terminate this Agreement, for any or no reason, at any time, with notice to LinkedIn. This notice will be effective upon LinkedIn processing your notice. LinkedIn may terminate the Agreement for any reason or no reason, at any time, with or without notice. This cancellation shall be effective immediately or as may be specified in the notice. For avoidance of doubt, only LinkedIn or the party paying for the services may terminate your access to any Premium Services. Termination of your LinkedIn account includes disabling your access to LinkedIn and may also bar you from any future use of LinkedIn. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Misuse of the Services.</h4>
        <p> LinkedIn may restrict, suspend or terminate the account of any User who abuses or misuses the Services. Misuse of the Services includes inviting other Users with whom you do not know to connect; abusing the LinkedIn messaging services; creating multiple or false profiles; using the Services commercially without LinkedIn&rsquo;s authorization, infringing any intellectual property rights, or any other behavior that LinkedIn, in its sole discretion, deems contrary to its purpose. In addition, and without limiting the foregoing, LinkedIn has adopted a policy of terminating accounts of Users who, in LinkedIn&rsquo;s sole discretion, are deemed to be repeat infringers under the United States Copyright Act. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Effect of Termination.</h4>
        <p> Upon the termination of your LinkedIn account, you lose access to the Services. In addition, LinkedIn may block access to the Services from an IP address or range of IP addresses associated with those of terminated Users. The terms of this Agreement shall survive any termination, except Sections 3 (&ldquo;Your Rights&rdquo;) and 4.a-b, and d (&ldquo;Our Rights and Obligations&rdquo;) hereof. </p>

    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
      <li>
        <h4>Choice of Law.</h4>
        <p> Except for any Disputes relating to intellectual property rights, obligations or any infringement claims, any disputes with LinkedIn arising out of or relating to the Agreement (&ldquo;Disputes&rdquo;) shall be governed by California law regardless of your country of origin or where you access LinkedIn, and notwithstanding of any conflicts of law principles and the United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Agreement to Arbitrate and Pay Attorneys&rsquo; Fees.</h4>
        <p> Any Disputes shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration under the rules and auspices of the American Arbitration Association, to be held in San Francisco, California, in English, with a written decision stating and legal reasoning issued by the arbitrator(s) at either party&rsquo;s request, and with arbitration costs and reasonable documented attorneys&rsquo; costs of both parties to be borne by the party that ultimately loses. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Exception from Arbitration Agreement</h4>
        <p> Either party may obtain injunctive relief (preliminary or permanent) and orders to compel arbitration or enforce arbitral awards in any court of competent jurisdiction. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Refundable Fee Advances for Consumers</h4>
        <p> If you are involved in a Dispute as a consumer without any commercial interests related to the Dispute, we will agree to conduct arbitration proceedings in a major City in your State if travel to California would constitute an undue burden for you, and we will advance any arbitration fees that exceed what you would have had to pay for court proceedings (if you substantiate and represent to us in a written statement what court proceedings would have cost) provided that you shall refund such amounts if we ultimately prevail in the arbitration. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

  <li>
    <h3>GENERAL TERMS.</h3>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
      <li>
        <h4>Severability.</h4>
        <p> If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be illegal, void, or unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be modified so as to render it enforceable and effective to the maximum extent possible in order to effect the intention of the provision; and if a court or arbitrator finds the modified provision invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be affected in any way. </p>
      </li>
      <li>

        <p> Where LinkedIn has provided you with a translation of the English language version of this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and/or any other documentation, you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and any other documentation, including additional terms of service for Premium Services, will govern your relationship with LinkedIn. </p>

    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
      <li>In accordance with Article L. 121-20 of the French Consumer Code, you are hereby informed that you have a seven (7) day period from the opening of your account to exercise your right of retraction, without any penalty or cause. However, in accordance with Article L. 121-20-2, 1&deg; of the French Consumer Code, this right of retraction cannot be exercised once you have used the services of the account in question.</li>
      <li>You agree that you will not participate directly or indirectly in a network seeking to implement practices similar to &ldquo;snowball&rdquo; sales or services as set forth in Articles L 122-6 and L 122-7 of the French Consumer Code.</li>

        <h4>Liability.</h4>
        <p> Subject to the provisions contained in the following paragraph and irrespective of legal ground, LinkedIn is liable only for damages resulting from the intentional misconduct or gross negligence of LinkedIn, its legal representatives, employees or authorized agents (&ldquo;Agents&rdquo;). </p>
        <p> For damages resulting from the gross negligence of LinkedIn or its Agents, liability is limited to damages commonly associated with the agreement in question. For damages caused by LinkedIn or its Agents in the absence of intentional misconduct or gross negligence, LinkedIn&rsquo;s liability is limited to the extent that violations extend to obligations the satisfaction of which is of critical importance to the achievement of the respective agreement&rsquo;s purpose (cardinal obligation). In the event that a cardinal obligation is violated by way of light negligence, liability is limited to damages commonly associated with the agreement in question. The above limitation of liability does not affect liability as prescribed by the German Product Liability Act or for damages from (1) injuries to life, body and health, or (2) the assumption of a guarantee or procurement risk. To the extent that LinkedIn&rsquo;s liability is excluded or limited under the foregoing provisions, such provisions also operate to the benefit of LinkedIn Agents in cases in which a User sues LinkedIn Agents directly. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Decompilation.</h4>
        <p> In case you download certain software provided by LinkedIn, you are only entitled to decompile the Software under the rules provided in Sec. 69e Copyright Act (&ldquo;Urhebergesetz&rdquo;) and only after LinkedIn has not provided the necessary information and data for allowing to establish interoperability with third party hard- or software after a written request within an adequate timeframe. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Right of Revocation.</h4>
        <p> If the User is a consumer (Sec. 13 German Civil Code), he or she may revoke registration for the Free or Premium Membership in writing (for example by letter, fax or eMail) without stating a reason within two (2) weeks of registration. Furthermore, the User may cancel registration for the Premium Membership in writing (e.g. by post, fax or eMail) within two (2) weeks without stating a reason, after changing from Free Membership to Premium Membership. The two-week periods begin with the reception of this information in text form. For exercising this right it is sufficient to send the revocation of the contract to the following address: </p>

        </p>
        <p> In the event of a valid cancellation, both parties shall be obliged to restore any benefits already received in accordance with legal provisions, and issue any gains (e.g. interest). If the User is unable or partially unable to restore the benefits, or only able to restore them in poor condition, to LinkedIn, then the User is obligated to reimburse LinkedIn for the corresponding value. Each party must fulfill its obligation for reimbursement within 30 days. The deadline begins for the User with the dispatch of the revocation; for LinkedIn, it begins with the reception of the revocation sent by the User. The right to revoke the contract expires if LinkedIn has begun providing the service with the User&rsquo;s explicit consent before the end of the deadline for the revocation or if the User has initiated the service himself or herself. </p>
