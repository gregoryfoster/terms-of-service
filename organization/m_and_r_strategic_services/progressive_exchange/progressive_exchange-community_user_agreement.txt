M+R Strategic Services aims to make the Progressive Exchange a safe and comfortable environment in which people can share ideas and knowledge with the goal of advancing and supporting the progressive community's online advocacy, fundraising and marketing efforts.

Membership is free, but you must agree to the following:

* Membership is limited to individuals working on behalf of progressive/liberal causes only. M+R reserves the right to remove listmembers who do not fit within this framework at any time.

* Keep your posts, questions and comments ON-TOPIC. This list is devoted to online strategies, tactics and tools to advance progressive causes. It is NOT a forum for open-ended political and social discussions, no matter how progressive the topics may be. If you’re not sure whether a topic is appropriate, please email the moderators to ask before posting.

* Keep your posts appropriate, constructive, and respectful. Take a moment to consider your message before you send it -- is it constructive or will it hurt someone's feelings? Please do not post in anger or use the list to air your grievances with another member. Address any conflicts directly with the other person or party OFF-LIST.
 
* Do not use the list to advertise your or your firm's services unless you are responding to a request for proposals or a suggestion for a type of vendor.

* Minimize the volume of emails by responding directly to the sender, rather than replying to the full list and by using the site’s forums and wikis. 

* Respect the decisions of the moderators.

* Add to our collective knowledge base by updating the wikis, uploading relevant documents and links, etc.
