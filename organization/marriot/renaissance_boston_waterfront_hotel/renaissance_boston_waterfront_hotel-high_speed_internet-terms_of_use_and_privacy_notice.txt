Privacy

The Companies respect the privacy of all users of the Service at Marriott and affiliated hotels. The Service does not correlate the user of this service with the sites visited. We do record the room number of the user for billing purposes. The record of a specific name associated with that room number is stored in a separate database to protect the privacy of the user. A log of all Service usage activity is maintained for system performance and maintenance purposes and system security requirements. At some hotels we provide the ability for a Service user to print a document or web pages while using the Service. While we take reasonable measures to secure the printer, because it is a shared printer we cannot ensure others may not see a document you print. The Companies and their vendors will only disclose usage information without your permission when required by law, or in good faith belief that such action is necessary to investigate or protect against harmful activities to Marriott guests, visitors, associates, or property (including this Service), or to others. If you should have any privacy related questions or concerns please send an e-mail to privacy@marriott.com.
