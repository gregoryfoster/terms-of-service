Our right to recover loss differs between our partners.&nbsp;To be fair, if we receive an amount from our partners&nbsp;that is higher than our liability to you under these Terms, we will, in our reasonable discretion, pass that amount on to you less any reasonable loss or expenses we have incurred.<br> &nbsp;<br> Without limiting any other of these Terms, if we are liable to you for any reason, our liability for each shipment is capped at the amount paid for the relevant shipment and the greater of $100 per shipment or any amount we receive from our partner in relation to the claim.<br> &nbsp;<br> You should note that, in some circumstances, the liability of our partners is limited under the Convention of the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air (Warsaw, 12 October 1929), Convention of the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air (Montreal, 28 May 1999) and the Convention on the Contract for International Carriage of Goods by Road (Geneva, 19 May 1956) or similar international conventions.<br> &nbsp;</p>
<h3>18.&nbsp; Time period for claims</h3>
<p>Any claims against us, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), for wilful acts or omission by us or our partners or otherwise, must be made within 28 days.<br> <br> We will not be liable for any claim unless legal proceedings are commenced within 24 weeks of notification of the claim under the preceding paragraph.<br> &nbsp;<br> To be valid, any claim must be in writing with the following information:<br> &nbsp;<br> (a) in the subject line of email: “Damaged item claim”; <br> &nbsp;<br> (b) description of the item and packaging together with a description of the nature of the damage (with a photo if practicable);<br> &nbsp;<br> (c) an invoice showing the value of the shipment; <br> &nbsp;<br> (d) your tracking number; and <br> &nbsp;<br> (e) your full name and address.<br> &nbsp;</p>
