    <h1>Commercial Entity Agreement</h1>
    <p>This Commercial Entity User Agreement (this “Agreement”) is provided to all users of the Square, Inc. (“Square”) mobile application, card reader device, and payments service (collectively, the “Square Service”) for the acceptance of credit card payments that are “Commercial Entities” as defined by Visa, Inc. and MasterCard International, Inc. (collectively, the “Card Brands”). As such an entity, the merchant signing or electronically agreeing to the terms hereof (“Merchant”) is entering into this Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the “Member”), and Paymentech, LLC (“Paymentech”), to govern the authorization, conveyance and settlement of Transactions utilizing the Square Service. By entering into this Agreement Merchant is fulfilling the Card Brand Rules requiring a direct contractual relationship between the Member and Merchant, and Merchant is agreeing to comply with Card Brand Rules as they pertain to payments Merchant receives through Square. Paymentech shall be a third-party beneficiary of, and may enforce any provisions of, or cease providing credit card processing services under, the Square User Agreement (“User Agreement”).</p>

<h3>1. Card Brand Rules and Acceptance Requirements.</h3>
<p>Merchant agrees to comply with all Card Brand Rules as may be applicable to Merchant and in effect from time to time, and such other procedures as Square and/or Paymentech may from time to time prescribe relating to Merchant’s acceptance of Cards. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Merchant agrees to each of the following requirements and restrictions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4>(a) Bona Fide Transactions.</h4>
  <p>Merchant shall not submit any Transaction that is not a bona fide Transaction. A bona fide Transaction means a Transaction that is (i) between the Merchant and its customer, (ii) for the sale of goods and/or services (or a Refund for such a sale) that are Merchant’s property or that Merchant has the legal right to sell, (iii) submitted on behalf of Merchant (and not on behalf of any third party), and (iv) legal, unauthorized by the Customer, non-fraudulent or otherwise damaging to the Card Brand(s), and is, to the Merchant’s knowledge, enforceable, collectible, and in full compliance with this Agreement, applicable law, or Card Brand Rules.</p>
  <h4>(b) Minimum/Maximum Thresholds For Card Acceptance; Surcharges.</h4>
  <p>Except as expressly permitted by law, Merchant shall not (i) set a dollar amount above or below which Merchant refuses to honor Cards, (ii) impose or require the Customer to pay any fee or charge (including, without limitation, any surcharge or finance charge or any of the fees payable by Merchant under this Agreement) in connection with or as a condition of the use or acceptance of a Card.</p>
  <h4>(c) Split Transactions.</h4>
  <p>Merchant agrees to submit a single Transaction for the full amount of each sale. Merchant shall not split a single Transaction into two or more Transactions.</p>
  <h4>(d) Taxes.</h4>
  <p>Merchant shall not add any tax or surcharge to Transactions, unless applicable law expressly allows or requires the Merchant to impose such tax or surcharge. If any tax or surcharge amount is allowed, such amount shall be included in the Transaction amount and shall not be collected separately.</p>
  <h4>(e) Use of Card Account Numbers.</h4>
  <p>Merchant shall not request or use Card Information for any purpose except as payment for its goods or services or to provide a Refund for goods or services previously sold, unless required by the Card Brand Rules. Merchant agrees that (i) it will not use the Card Information for any purpose that it knows or should know to be fraudulent or in violation of any Card Brand; (ii) it will not sell, purchase, provide or exchange in any manner or disclose Card Information to anyone other than its acquirer, any Card Brand, or in response to a government request; and (iii) it will be compliant with the Security Standards, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) and will cooperate in a forensic investigation if so required. </p>
  <h4>(f) Existing Debt.</h4>
  <p>Merchant shall not submit a Transaction for any purpose other than a current Transaction. Transactions shall not represent the collection of a dishonored check or the collection, transfer or refinancing of any existing or prior debt or obligation. Merchant shall not attempt to recharge a Customer for an item that has been the subject of a Chargeback by the Customer, even with the Customer’s consent. Merchant shall not submit any Transaction which it knows or should know to be unenforceable or uncollectable.</p>
  <h4>(g)  Time of Payment.</h4>
  <p>At the time Merchant accepts a Card for any goods or services, the goods shall have been provided or shipped or the services actually rendered to the Customer, except as specifically stated otherwise in Merchant’s Application (or otherwise approved in writing by Paymentech in advance).</p>
  <h4>(h) Cash Advances.</h4>
  <p>Merchant shall not disburse or advance any cash to a Customer (except as authorized by the Card Brand Rules) or to itself or any of its representatives, agents, or employees in connection with a Transaction, nor shall Merchant accept payment for effecting credits or issuing Refunds to a Customer.</p>
  <h4>(i)  Discrimination.</h4>
  <p>Unless permitted by the Card Brand Rules, Merchant shall not engage in any practice that unfavorably discriminates against or provides unequal treatment of any Card Brand relative to any other Card Brand.</p>
  <h4>(j) Refunds/Credits.</h4>
  <p>Any Transaction submitted to Paymentech to credit a Customer’s Card account represents a Refund for a prior Transaction submitted to Paymentech using the same Card.</p>
  <h4>(k) Installment Plans.</h4>
  <p>Unless specifically stated in its Application or otherwise approved in writing by Paymentech in advance, Merchant shall not accept Cards in connection with installment plans. If the Customer pays in installments or on a deferred payment plan, as previously approved by Paymentech, a Transaction Data record has been prepared separately for each installment transaction or deferred payment on the dates the Customer agreed to be charged. All installments and deferred payments, whether or not they have been submitted to Paymentech for processing, shall be deemed to be a part of the original Transaction.</p>
  <h4>(l) Recurring Transactions.</h4>
  <p>For recurring Transactions, Merchant must (i) obtain the Customer’s consent to periodically charge the Customer on a recurring basis for the goods or services purchased; (ii) retain this permission for the duration of the recurring services and provide it upon request to Paymentech or the issuing bank of the Customer’s Card; and (iii) retain written documentation specifying the frequency of the recurring charge and the duration of time during which such charges may be made. Merchant shall not submit any recurring transaction after receiving:  (i) a cancellation notice from the Customer; or (ii) notice from Paymentech or any Card Brand (via authorization code or otherwise) that the Card is not to be honored. Merchant shall include in its Transaction Data the electronic indicator that the Transaction is a recurring Transaction.</p>
  <h4>(m)  Merchant Identification.</h4>
  <p>Merchant agrees to prominently and unequivocally inform the Customer of the identity of the Merchant at all points of interaction.</p>
  <h4>(n)  Visa and MasterCard Marks.</h4>
  <p>Merchant is authorized to use the Visa and MasterCard logos or marks only on Merchant's promotional materials and website to indicate that Visa and MasterCard cards are accepted as funding sources for Square Transactions.</p>
  <h4>(o)  Chargebacks.</h4>
  <p>Merchant shall use all reasonable methods to resolve disputes with the Customer. Should a Chargeback dispute occur, Merchant shall promptly comply with all requests for information from Square. Merchant shall not attempt to recharge a Customer for an item that has been charged back to the Customer, even with the Customer’s consent. You shall have full liability for the amount of any and all successful Chargebacks (and may have conditional liability for such Chargebacks prior to their final adjudication pursuant to the Card Brand Rules). </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>2. Authorizations Required For All Transactions.</h3>
<p>Merchant is required to obtain an authorization through the Square Service, in accordance with this Agreement, for each Transaction. Paymentech reserves the right to refuse to process any Transaction Data presented by Merchant unless it includes a proper authorization.</p>

<h3>3. Refunds.</h3>
<p>Merchant is required to maintain a Refund Policy if Merchant limits refund/exchange terms or other specific conditions for Card Transactions, Merchant's policy must be clearly provided to the Customer prior to the sale and as part of the sale confirmation process. Proper disclosure would include wording that is prominently displayed and states “NO REFUND, EXCHANGE ONLY” or something substantially similar and includes any special terms. Qualifying Merchant’s refund or exchange terms does not completely eliminate Merchant’s liability for a refund because consumer protection laws and Card Brand Rules frequently allow the Customer to still dispute these items. If, under Merchant’s Refund Policy, Merchant allows a Refund, Merchant shall implement such Refund within three (3) days of approving the Customer’s request for such Refund. The amount of a Refund cannot exceed the amount shown as the total on the original Transaction Data except by the exact amount required to reimburse the Customer for shipping charges that the Customer paid to return merchandise. Merchant shall not accept any payment from a Customer as consideration for issuing a Refund.</p>

<h3>4. Term and Termination.</h3>
<p>This Agreement is effective upon the date Merchant agrees to it (by electronically indicating acceptance hereof or otherwise) and continues so long as Merchant uses the Square service or until terminated by Merchant or Paymentech. This Agreement will terminate automatically upon any termination or expiration of Merchant’s User Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated by Paymentech at any time based on a breach of any of Merchant's obligations under this Agreement or the User Agreement, or based on the termination of the payment processing relationship between Square and Paymentech. In addition and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Paymentech may terminate this Agreement at any time upon written notice to Merchant as a result of any of the following events: (a) irregular Transactions by Merchant, excessive Chargebacks, or any other circumstances which, in Paymentech’s discretion, may increase Paymentech’s or Member’s exposure for Merchant’s Chargebacks or otherwise present an Anticipated Risk to Paymentech; (b) Merchant fails in any material respect in performance or observance of any term, covenant, condition, or agreement contained in this Agreement or the User Agreement, including, without limitation, the funding or establishing of any reserve account which Square may require; (c) a case or other proceeding shall be commenced by or against Merchant in any court of competent jurisdiction seeking relief under the Bankruptcy Code or under any other laws, domestic or foreign, relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, winding up, or adjustment of debts, the appointment of a trustee, receiver, custodian, liquidator, or the like of Merchant, or of all or any substantial part of the assets, domestic or foreign, of Merchant, and such case or proceeding shall continue undismissed or unstayed for a period of 60 consecutive days, or an order granting the relief requested in such case or proceeding against Merchant (including, without limitation, an order for relief under the Bankruptcy Code) shall be entered;  (d) any Card Brand notifies Paymentech or Member that it is no longer willing to accept Merchant’s Transaction Data or requires Paymentech or Member to terminate or limit this Agreement; (e) Merchant or any person owning or controlling Merchant’s business is listed in one or more databases of terminated or high risk merchants maintained by the Card Brands; or (f) Merchant engages in conduct that creates or could tend to create harm or loss to the goodwill of any Card Brand, Paymentech, or Square, or which otherwise may impose undue risk of harm to any Card Brand, Paymentech or Square. Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, those terms which by their nature are intended to survive termination (including without limitation, indemnification obligations and limitations of liability) shall survive.</p>

<p>Termination does not affect either party’s respective rights and obligations under this Agreement as to Transaction Data submitted before termination.</p>

<h3>5. Indemnity.</h3>
<p>Paymentech agrees to indemnify and hold Merchant harmless from and against all losses, liabilities, damages and expenses: (a) resulting from any breach of any warranty, covenant, or agreement or any misrepresentation by each of us under this Agreement; or (b) arising from our or our employee's gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement. Merchant agrees to indemnify and hold Paymentech harmless from and against all losses, liabilities, damages and expense: (a) resulting from any breach of any warranty, covenant or agreement or any misrepresentation by Merchant under this Agreement; (b) arising out of Merchant's or its employees' negligence or willful misconduct, in connection with Transactions or otherwise arising from Merchant's provision of goods and services to Customers; (c) arising out of Merchant's use of the Square Service; of (d) arising out of any third party indemnifications Paymentech is obligated to make, or liabilities or other obligations Paymentech may incur, as a result of Merchant's actions (including indemnifications of or liabilities to, any Card Brand or Card-issuing bank).</p>

<h3>6. Information About Merchant’s Business.</h3>
<blockquote>
  <h4>6.1	Additional Financial Information.</h4>
  <p>Upon five (5) days’ written notice at any time, Merchant agrees to furnish to Paymentech such financial statements and financial information as Paymentech may request relating to Merchant, Merchant’s creditworthiness and/or Merchant’s ability to fulfill its financial and other obligations under this Agreement.</p>
  <h4>6.2	Audit Rights.</h4>
  <p>With prior notice and during Merchant’s normal business hours, Paymentech’s duly authorized representatives may visit Merchant’s business premises and may examine Merchant’s books and records that pertain to Merchant’s Transactions or Merchant’s compliance with this Agreement.</p>
  <h4>6.3 Other Information.</h4>
  <p>Merchant agrees to provide Paymentech at least 30 days’ prior written notice of its intent to change current product lines or services, Merchant’s trade name, or the manner in which Merchant accepts Payment Instruments. If Paymentech determines such a change is material to its relationship with Merchant, Paymentech may refuse to process Transaction Data made subsequent to the change or terminate this Agreement. Merchant agrees to provide Paymentech with prompt written notice if Merchant is the subject of any voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition or proceeding. Merchant’s signature on this Agreement authorizes Paymentech to perform any credit check deemed necessary with respect to Merchant. Merchant will also provide Paymentech with prompt written notice of (i) any adverse change in Merchant’s financial condition, (ii) any planned or anticipated liquidation or substantial change the basic nature of Merchant’s business, (iii) any transfer or sale of any substantial part (25% or more in value) of Merchant’s total assets, or (iv) if Merchant or Merchant’s parent is not a corporation whose shares are listed on a national securities exchange or on the over-the-counter market, any change in the control or ownership of Merchant or Merchant’s parent. Merchant will also notify Paymentech of any judgment, writ, warrant of attachment, execution or levy against any substantial part (25% or more in value) of Merchant’s total assets not later than three days after Merchant obtains knowledge of any such judgment, writ, warrant of attachment, execution or levy.</p>

  <h4>8.9 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Arbitration.</h4>
  <p>This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without reference to conflict of law provisions. Any action, proceeding, arbitration hearing or mediation relating to or arising from this Agreement must be brought, held, or otherwise occur in Dallas County, Dallas, Texas. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. IT PROVIDES THAT ANY CLAIM MAY BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION AND THAT (i) MERCHANT IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY TO RESOLVE ANY CLAIM ALLEGED AGAINST PAYMENTECH, MEMBER, OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES; (ii) MERCHANT IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO HAVE A COURT RESOLVE ANY CLAIM ALLEGED AGAINST PAYMENTECH, MEMBER OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES; (iii) MERCHANT IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, AND/OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, IN ANY LAWSUIT OR ARBITRATION FILED AGAINST PAYMENTECH, MEMBER AND/OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES. Any claim, dispute, or controversy ("Claim") by either Merchant, Paymentech or Member against the other, or against the officers, directors, employees, agents, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, beneficiaries, agents, successors, or assigns of the other, arising from or relating in any way to this Agreement or to the relationship formed between the parties as a result of this Agreement, including Claims regarding the applicability of this arbitration clause or the validity of the entire Agreement, shall be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). All Claims are subject to arbitration, no matter what theory they are based on. This includes Claims based on contract, tort (including intentional tort), fraud, agency, Merchant, Paymentech’s or Member’s negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions, or any other source of law. Claims and remedies sought as part of a class action, private attorney general, or other representative action are subject to arbitration on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis only, and the arbitrator may award relief only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. Merchant and Paymentech will agree on another arbitration forum if the AAA ceases operations. The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator and will be limited solely to the Claim between Merchant and Paymentech and/or Member. The arbitration, or any portion of it, will not be consolidated with any other arbitration and will not be conducted on a class-wide or class action basis. The prohibition against class action contained in this Section shall be non-severable from the remainder of this Section. If either party prevails in the arbitration of any Claim against the other, the non-prevailing party will reimburse the prevailing party for any fees it paid to the AAA in connection with the arbitration, as well as for any reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the prevailing party in connection with such arbitration. Any decision rendered in such arbitration proceedings will be final and binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction. Rules and forms of the AAA may be obtained and Claims may be filed at any AAA office, www.adr.org, or 335 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017, telephone 1-800-778-7879. This arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16. This arbitration agreement applies to all Claims now in existence or that may arise in the future. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent any party's use of (or advancement of any Claims, defenses, or offsets in) bankruptcy or repossession, replevin, judicial foreclosure or any other prejudgment or provisional remedy relating to any collateral, security, or other property interests for contractual debts now or hereafter owned by either party to the other. IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, MERCHANT AND PAYMENTECH MAY OTHERWISE HAVE HAD A RIGHT OR OPPORTUNITY TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR A JURY AND/OR TO PARTICIPATE OR BE REPRESENTED IN LITIGATION FILED IN COURT BY OTHERS (INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS), BUT EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED ABOVE, THOSE RIGHTS, INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, ARE WAIVED AND ALL CLAIMS MUST NOW BE RESOLVED THROUGH ARBITRATION.</p>
  <h4>8.10 Force Majeure.</h4>
  <p>Neither party will be liable for delays in processing or other nonperformance caused by such events as fires, telecommunications failures, utility failures, power failures, equipment failures, labor strife, riots, war, terrorist attack, nonperformance of our vendors or suppliers, acts of God, or other causes over which the respective party has no reasonable control, except that nothing in this Section 15.11 will affect or excuse your liabilities and obligations for Chargebacks, refunds, or unfulfilled products and services.</p>
  <h4>8.11 Amendment.</h4>
  <p>This Agreement may be amended at any time by Paymentech upon 30 days notice to you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the terms of this Agreement must be amended pursuant to a change required by the Card Brand Rules or any third party with jurisdiction over the matters described herein, such amendment will be effective immediately. Your electronic signature or continued submission of Transactions to us following such notice will be deemed to be your acceptance of such amendment.</p>
