  <h1>Merchant User Agreement</h1>
  <p>This Merchant User Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you (“you,” “your”) and Square, Inc. (“Square,” “we,” “our” or “us”) governing your use of Square’s payment processing services, Square Card Reader and Square Register (together, the “Services”). Please read this Agreement carefully. This Agreement is divided into two parts. Part One explains all of the terms that govern your use of the Services. Part Two contains additional legal terms, including provisions that limit our liability to you and require individual arbitration for any potential legal dispute. To use the Services, you must accept all of the terms of this Agreement.</p>
    <section>
      <h3>Part One:<br>
Terms Governing<br>
Use of the Service
</h3>
          <h4>1. Square Account Registration.</h4>
          <p>You must open an account with Square (a “Square Account”) in order to use the Services. Our registration process will ask you for information including your name and other personal information. You must provide accurate and complete information in response to our questions. You must also keep the information that you provide up-to-date.</p>
          <h4>2. User Name.</h4>
          <p>You must choose a reasonably descriptive user name that clearly identifies you or your business. This name will appear on the Payer’s credit or debit card statement. If a transaction dispute results from your failure to use a reasonably descriptive user name, you agree to indemnify Square for any costs stemming from such dispute.</p>
          <h4>3. Software.</h4>
          <p>The software associated with Square Card Reader and Square Register is part of the Services. Among other things, the software enables you to access and use the Services. When you install the software, you will be asked to create your user profile and to establish a Square Account on the Square website. You must complete this and other processes in order to access any funds that you accept through the Services. You must install any and all software updates to continue to use the Services.</p>
          <h4>4. Verification and Inspection.</h4>
          <p>If your request to open a Square Account is approved, Square may request additional information from you at any time. Square may ask you to present invoices from your suppliers, a government issued identification such as a passport or driver’s license, or a business license. Square may also ask for permission to inspect your business location. If you refuse any of these requests, your Square Account may be terminated. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate the Square Account of any user who provides inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete information, or fails to comply with the account registration requirements.</p>
          <h4>5. Compatible Mobile Devices and Third Party Carriers.</h4>
          <p>Your Square Account permits you to accept payment card transactions on a compatible mobile device. Devices modified contrary to the manufacturer’s software or hardware guidelines, including but not limited to disabling hardware or software controls—sometimes referred to as “jailbreaking”—are not compatible mobile devices. You acknowledge that the use of a modified device to use the Services is expressly prohibited, constitutes a violation of the terms of this agreement, and is grounds for termination of your Square Account. Square does not warrant that the Services will be compatible with your mobile device or third party carrier.<br><br>
Your use of the Services may be subject to the terms of your agreements with your mobile device manufacturer and your carrier. The Services are currently available on: AT&amp;T, T-Mobile®, Sprint, Nextel, Virgin Mobile, Verizon Wireless, Alltel, Dobson, Cellular One, NTelos, US Cellular and Cincinnati Bell."
</p>
          <h4>6. Your Square Account.</h4>
          <p>By creating a Square Account, you confirm that you are either a legal resident of the United States, a United States citizen, or a business entity authorized to conduct business by the state in which it operates. The Services and your Square Account may only be used in the fifty states of the United States of America and the District of Columbia. You may not export the Services directly or indirectly, and you acknowledge that the Services may be subject to export restrictions imposed by US law, including US Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. Chapter VII).<br><br>
By creating a Square Account, you also confirm that you will not accept payments in connection with the following businesses or business activities: (1) any illegal activity, (2) buyers or membership clubs, (3) credit counseling or repair agencies, (4) credit protection or identity theft protection services, (5) direct marketing or subscription offers or services, (6) infomercial sales, (7) internet/mail order/telephone order pharmacies or pharmacy referral services (where fulfillment of medication is performed with an internet or telephone consultation, absent a physical visit with a physician including re-importation of pharmaceuticals from foreign countries), (8) multi-level marketing businesses, (9) inbound or outbound telemarketers, (10) prepaid phone cards or phone services, (11) rebate based businesses, (12) up-sell merchants, (13) bill payment services, (14) betting, including lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, off-track betting, and wagers at races, (15) financial institutions offering manual or automated cash disbursements, (16) financial institutions offering merchandise and services, (17) sales of money-orders or foreign currency by non-financial institutions, (18) wire transfer money orders, (19) high-risk merchants, including telemarketing merchants, (20) service station merchants, (21) automated fuel dispensers, (22) adult entertainment oriented products or services (in any medium, e.g., internet, telephone or printed material), (23) internet/mail order/telephone order firearm or weapon sales, (24) internet/mail order/telephone order cigarette or tobacco sales, (25) drug paraphernalia, (26) occult materials, (27) hate products, (28) escort services, and (29) bankruptcy attorneys.<br><br>
By accepting this Agreement you confirm that you will satisfy these requirements.<br><br>
Your Square Account permits you to offer loyalty programs to your customers. If you offer such a loyalty program, you (and not Square) are responsible for ensuring that your program and any associated rewards are compliant with applicable federal and state laws, including laws governing prepaid cards and special offers such as rebates and coupons. You agree to make available to your customers any terms and conditions applicable to your loyalty program.
</p>
          <h4>7. Our Role.</h4>
          <p>The Services allow you to accept payments, including card-based payments initiated with cards bearing the trademarks of MasterCard International Inc. and Visa Inc. (collectively, the “Networks”). We are not a bank, and we do not offer banking services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury. We also do not offer money service business (“MSB”) services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury.<br><br>
As a merchant payment processor, Square processes payments you receive from your customers. This means that we collect, analyze and relay information generated in connection with these payments.<br><br>
In order to serve in this role, we must enter into agreements with Networks, other processors and banks. These third parties require that some of our users enter into an agreement with Square’s payment processor of record. If you are such a user, we will provide you a “<a href="https://squareup.com/legal/cea">Commercial Entity Agreement</a> that you must complete in order to use the Services. This may happen during the registration process or at some other time. If you fail to complete a “Commercial Entity Agreement,” we may suspend or terminate your Square Account.
</p>
          <h4>8. Your Authorization.</h4>
          <p>By accepting the terms of this Agreement, you authorize us to hold, receive, and disburse funds on your behalf. Your authorization permits us to generate a paper draft or an electronic funds transfer to process each payment transaction that you authorize. Your authorizations will remain in full force and effect until your Square Account is closed or terminated.</p>
          <h4>9. Restricted Use.</h4>
          <p>You may use the Services only to the extent that you obey all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to your use of the Services. You may not act as a payment intermediary, aggregator or service bureau or otherwise resell our services on behalf of any third party. This means that you may not use the Services to handle, process or transmit funds for any third party. You also may not use the Services to process cash advances.</p>
          <h4>10. Unauthorized or Illegal Use.</h4>
          <p>We may decide not to authorize or settle any transaction that you submit to us if we believe that the transaction is in violation of any Square agreement, or exposes you, other Square users, our processors or Square to harm. Harm includes fraud and other criminal acts. If we reasonably suspect that your Square Account has been used for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose, you give us express authorization to share information about you, your Square Account, and any of your transactions with law enforcement.</p>
          <h4>11. Accepted Cards.</h4>
          <p>Square works with any US-issued and most non-US issued credit, debit, pre-paid, or gift cards with a Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover logo. We may remove or add Cards that we accept at anytime without prior notice. We will only process Cards that receive an authorization from the applicable Network or card issuer. The person who presents the card to you (“the Payer”), may not be authorized to use the card or otherwise contest the transaction through the Chargeback process (described below).</p>
          <h4>12. Applicable Network Rules.</h4>
          <p>The Networks require that you and Square comply with all applicable bylaws, rules, and regulations (“Network Rules”). The Networks have historically reserved the right to amend their rules and regulations. Square may be required to change this agreement in connection with amendments to the Network Rules. Significant portions of the Network Rules are available to the public at usa.visa.com and www.mastercard.com.<br><br>
Network Rules currently prohibit you from (a) assessing a surcharge for the use of a Card in connection with any transaction, or (b) dispensing cash on any Card transaction. The Rules also restrict your use of Network logos to indicating your acceptance of the Network cards and to other uses expressly authorized by the Networks.
</p>
          <h4>13. Underwriting.</h4>
          <p>Square will review some or all of the information that you submit in connection with your request to sign up for the Services. Square may forward such information on to its processor. In order to be eligible to use the Services, you must agree that Square may share information about you and your Square Account to its processor. After you submit your application, Square or its processor may conclude that you will not be permitted to use the Services.<br><br>
By accepting the terms of this Agreement, you specifically authorize Square to request identity verifying information about you, including a consumer report that contains your name and address. Square may periodically obtain additional reports to determine whether you continue to meet the requirements for a Square Account.<br><br>
You agree that Square is permitted to contact and share information about you and your application (including whether you are approved or declined), and your Square Account with your bank or other financial institution. This includes sharing information (a) about your transactions for regulatory or compliance purposes, (b) for use in connection with the management and maintenance of the service, (c) to create and update their customer records about you and to assist them in better serving you, and (d) to conduct Square’s risk management process.
</p>
          <h4>14. Our Fees.</h4>
          <p>You agree to pay the applicable fees listed on our Fee Schedule (“Fees”) whenever you use the Services. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, we reserve the right to change our Fees. If we change our Fees, we will give you thirty (30) days notice of any change. You will not be permitted to continue to use the Services unless you consent to the change in Fees. To withdraw your consent, you will need to close your Square Account. All Balances and all Fees, charges, and payments collected or paid through the Services are denominated in US dollars.</p>
          <h4>15. Access to Square Account Funds.</h4>
          <p>Subject to the payout schedule identified below, we will deposit to your Square Account the amounts actually received by us for transactions submitted through the Services (less any applicable Fees). Once your bank account information is verified, Square will automatically deposit your money in your designated bank account when your Square Account balance exceeds $10.<br><br>
In the event that you do not have an ACH-enabled Square Account, you may request a physical check. Check requests will be subject to a processing fee and an identity verification process.<br><br>
Funds for any given transaction will not be deposited until the transaction is deemed complete. Transactions will be deemed complete when we have received or sent the funds and when we or the designated financial institutions have accepted the transaction or funds. You are responsible for monitoring your transactions and ensuring that our payments to you are correct. You must notify us of any errors in payments made to you within sixty (60) days of the error first appearing on your electronic transaction history. Failure to notify us of such an error will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.
</p>
          <h4>16a. Payout Schedule - Standard.</h4>
          <p>Once you validate your US bank account, Square will automatically initiate a payout to your bank account at the end of every business day. Payouts to your bank account will normally register within 1-2 business days.</p>
          <h4>16b. Payout Schedule - Card-Not-Present Sales.</h4>
          <p>If you accrue more than $2,002 in card-not-present sales during any trailing seven day period, Square will defer depositing the amount in excess of $2,002 for 30 days. Card-not-present sales are transactions where the payment card is not swiped using the Square Card Reader. If you think your account is likely to exceed $2,002 in card-not-present sales per week, <a href="https://squareup.com/help">contact Square support</a> to inquire about accelerating your payout schedule. Upon receiving this request, or once you exceed $2,002 in weekly card-not-present sales, Square will conduct a review of your Square Account to determine if you qualify for acceleration. Square will consider a variety of factors in making its decision, including but not limited to a proprietary set of rules, chargeback rates, transaction behavior, and other supplemental data about your business.</p>
          <h4>17. Availability of Funds.</h4>
          <p>Should Square need to conduct an investigation or resolve any pending dispute related to your Square Account, we may defer payout or restrict access to your funds for the entire time it takes for us to do so. We also may defer payout or restrict access to your funds as required by law or court order, or if otherwise requested by law enforcement or governmental entity.</p>
          <h4>18. Square Account History.</h4>
          <p>When a payment is made to your Square Account, we will update your Square Account activity on the website and provide you a transaction confirmation. The confirmation will serve as your receipt. Summaries of your Square Account activity, including monthly statements, are available on our website for up to one year of account activity. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for (a) compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your Square Account and your use of the Services, and (b) reconciling all transactional information that is associated with your Square Account. If you believe that there is an error or unauthorized transaction activity is associated with your Square Account, you agree to contact us immediately.</p>
          <h4>19. Reserve.</h4>
          <p>At any time and from time to time, we may temporarily suspend or delay payments to you and/or designate an amount of funds that we must maintain in your Square Account or in a separate reserve account (a “Reserve”) to secure the performance of your payment obligations under this Agreement. We may require a Reserve for any reason, including if you have a high rate of Chargebacks (described in Section 27), refunds, or other indications of performance problems related to your use of the Services. The Reserve will be in an amount as reasonably determined by us to cover anticipated Chargebacks, returns, unshipped merchandise and/or unfulfilled products or services or credit risk based on your processing history or such amount designated by our processor. The Reserve may be raised, reduced or removed at any time by Square, in its sole discretion, based on your payment history, a credit review, the amount of any arbitration award or court judgment against you in Square’s favor, or otherwise as Square or its processor may determine or require. If you do not have sufficient funds in your Reserve, we may fund the Reserve from any funding source associated with your Square Account, including but not limited to any funds (a) deposited by you, (b) due to you under this Agreement, or (c) available in your bank account, or other payment instrument registered with us. You grant us a security interest in and lien on any and all funds held in any Reserve, and also authorize us to make any withdrawals or debits from the Reserve, without prior notice to you, to collect amounts that you owe us under this Agreement, including without limitation for any reversals of deposits or transfers made to your Square Account. You will execute any additional documentation required for us to perfect our security interest in any funds in the Reserve. This security interest survives for as long as we hold funds in your Reserve.</p>
          <h4>20. Square Account Balances.</h4>
          <p>You may, but are not required to hold monetary balances that you receive in your Square Account (your “Balance”). When you carry a Balance, your funds will be co-mingled and held with other participants’ funds in one or more pooled accounts at one or more FDIC-insured banks by us on your behalf and for the benefit of you and other users holding balances (each a “Pooled Account”). US dollar balances held in the pooled account are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance, meaning that your Balance may be insured up to the FDIC maximum, which is currently $250,000. We have sole discretion over the establishment and maintenance of any pooled account. Funds associated with your Square Account will at all times be held separate from our corporate funds. We will not use your funds for our corporate purposes (including the granting of any security or similar interest), will not voluntarily make funds available to our creditors in the event of bankruptcy or for any other purpose, and will not knowingly permit our creditors to attach the funds. You will not receive interest or any other earnings on any funds that we handle for you. As consideration for using the Services, you irrevocably assign to us all rights and legal interests to any interest and/or other earnings that may accrue or are attributable to our holding of your Balance in a pooled account or Reserve (described below).</p>
          <h4>21. Receipts.</h4>
          <p>When your customer is present at the time of the transaction and signs the Square Signature Screen, you benefit from the Payment Network rules for card present transactions. You agree to request that your customer personally sign for all transactions greater than $25.00 when your customer is present. You must make a written receipt available to your customers for any transaction greater than fifteen dollars ($15.00). You may give your customers the option to receive or decline a written receipt. As a convenience, but not in lieu of a written receipt, you may also offer Square electronic receipts for delivery through SMS or email to your customers.</p>
          <h4>22. Receipts for 501(c)(3) Organizations.</h4>
          <p>If you operate a 501(c)(3) organization you may offer Square electronic receipts to your donors as a convenience, by completing the required fields in the “Account” section of our website. You acknowledge that not all payments made to your organization will be eligible for classification as “tax deductible to the extent allowed by law,” and you assume full responsibility for the classification of your transactions. Square specifically disclaims any liability in this regard.</p>
          <h4>23. Usage of Shortcode (778273).</h4>
          <p>Square will send you real-time receipts via a text message, which you may also use as secondary authentication. Standard message and data rates may apply (check with your carrier). You may start by entering your mobile phone number during a transaction with a Square user, or by opting-in at <a href="https://squareup.com/sms">squareup.com</a>. For help, text HELP to 778273, text STOP to quit.</p>
          <h4>24. Taxes.</h4>
          <p>You are responsible for determining any and all taxes assessed, incurred, or required to be collected, paid, or withheld for any reason in connection your use of our software and services (“Taxes”). You also are solely responsible for collecting, withholding, reporting, and remitting correct Taxes to the appropriate tax authority. We are not obligated to, nor will we determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from any transaction.<br><br>
If in a given calendar year you receive (i) more than $20,000 in gross amount of payments and (ii) more than 200 payments, Square will report annually to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), as required by law, your name, address, Tax Identification Number (such as a Social Security Number (SSN), or Employer Identification Number (EIN)), the total dollar amount of the payments you receive in a calendar year, and the total dollar amount of the payments you receive for each month in a calendar year.
</p>
          <h4>25. Customer Service.</h4>
          <p>You are solely responsible for all customer service issues relating to your goods or services, including pricing, order fulfillment, order cancellation by you or customer, returns, refunds and adjustments, rebates, functionality and warranty, technical support, and feedback concerning experiences with your personnel, policies or processes. In performing customer service, you will always present yourself as a separate entity from us. As between you and us, we are solely responsible for customer service issues relating to any Square Account, payment, card processing, debiting or crediting.</p>
          <h4>26. Refunds and Returns.</h4>
          <p>By accepting payment card transactions with a Square, you agree to process returns of, and provide refunds and adjustments for, your goods or services through your Square Account in accordance with this Agreement and Network Rules. Network Rules require that you will (a) maintain a fair return, cancellation or adjustment policy; (b) disclose your return or cancellation policy to customers at the time of purchase, (c) not give cash refunds to a customer in connection with a Card sale, unless required by law, and (d) not accept cash or any other item of value for preparing a Card sale refund. The amount of the refund/adjustment must include any associated taxes required to be refunded and cannot exceed the amount shown as the total on the original sales data except by the exact amount required to reimburse the customer for postage that the customer paid to return merchandise. If you accept returns and are making an uneven exchange of merchandise (e.g., the sales price is not the same), you must issue a credit for the total amount of the merchandise being returned and complete a new sale for any new merchandise. Please be aware, if your refund policy prohibits returns or is unsatisfactory to the buyer, you may still receive a Chargeback relating to such sales.<br><br>
You can process a refund through your Square Account up to sixty (60) days from the day you accepted the payment. If your Square balance is insufficient to cover the refund, Square will request your authorization to withdraw up to the requested refund amount from your bank account. Square will then withdraw the amount you were paid (the sale amount minus the initial transaction fee) from your bank account, and credit it back into your customer’s card. The Fees are also refunded by Square, so the full purchase amount is always returned to your customer. Square has no obligation to accept any returns of any of your goods or services on your behalf.
</p>
          <h4>27. Your Liability for Chargebacks.</h4>
          <p>The amount of a transaction may be reversed or charged back to your Square Account (a “Chargeback”) if the transaction (a) is disputed, (b) is reversed for any reason by the Network, our processor, or a Payer’s or our financial institution, (c) was not authorized or we have any reason to believe that the transaction was not authorized, or (d) is allegedly unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of the terms of this Agreement.</p>
          <h4>28. Our Collection Rights for Chargebacks.</h4>
          <p>For any transaction that results in a Chargeback, we may withhold the Chargeback amount in a Reserve. We may deduct the amount of any Chargeback and any associated Fees, fines, or penalties listed in the Fee Schedule or assessed by the Association or our processor from your Square Account (including without limitation any Reserve), any proceeds due to you, your bank account, or other payment instrument registered with us. If you have pending Chargebacks, we may delay payouts from your Square Account. Further, if we reasonably believe that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you under this Agreement until such time that: (a) a Chargeback is assessed due to a customer’s complaint, in which case we will retain the funds; (b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the customer may dispute that the transaction has expired; or (c) we determine that a Chargeback on the transaction will not occur. If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you will pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand. You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses, incurred by or on behalf of us in connection with the collection of all Square Account deficit balances unpaid by you.</p>
          <h4>29. Excessive Chargebacks.</h4>
          <p>If we determine that you are incurring an excessive amount of Chargebacks, we may establish controls or conditions governing your Square Account, including without limitation, by (a) establishing new processing fees, (b) creating a Reserve in an amount reasonably determined by us to cover anticipated Chargebacks and related fees, (c) delaying payouts, and (d) terminating or suspending the Services.</p>
          <h4>30. Contesting Chargebacks.</h4>
          <p>You agree to assist us when requested, at your expense, to investigate any of your transactions processed through the Services. To that end, you permit us to share information about a Chargeback with the payer, the payer’s financial institution, and your financial institution in order to investigate and/or mediate a Chargeback. We will request necessary information from you to contest the Chargeback. If the Chargeback is contested successfully, we will release the reserved funds to your Square Account. If a Chargeback dispute is not resolved in your favor by the Association or issuing bank or you choose not to contest the Chargeback, we may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees as described in this Agreement. You acknowledge that your failure to assist us in a timely manner when investigating a transaction, including providing necessary documentation within fifteen (15) days of our request, may result in an irreversible Chargeback. We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating and/or investigating Chargeback disputes.</p>
          <h4>31. Our Set-off Rights.</h4>
          <p>To the extent permitted by law, we may set off against the Balances for any obligation you owe us under this Agreement, including without limitation any Chargebacks. All Fees are charged at the time we process a transaction and are deducted first from the transferred or collected funds and thereafter from the Balance in your Square Account. If you owe us an amount that exceeds your Balance, we may charge or debit a payment instrument registered in your Square Account. Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on demand will be a breach of this Agreement. You will be liable for our costs associated with collection in addition to the amount owed, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and expenses, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.</p>
          <h4>32. Dormant Square Accounts.</h4>
          <p>If there is no activity in your Square Account (including access or payment transactions) for at least two (2) years, consecutively, and you have a Balance, we will notify you by sending an email to your registered email address and give you the option of keeping your Square Account open and maintaining the Balance, withdrawing the Balance, or requesting a check. If you do not respond to our notice within thirty (30) days, we will automatically close your Square Account and escheat your funds in accordance with applicable law, and if permitted, to Square.</p>
          <h4>33. Square Processing Errors.</h4>
          <p>We will attempt to rectify processing errors that we discover. If the error resulted in your receipt of less than the correct amount to which you were entitled, Square will credit your Square Account for the difference. If the error results in your receipt of more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, Square will debit the extra funds from your Square Account. Square will only correct transactions that you process incorrectly if and when you notify us of such an error. Your failure to notify us of a processing error within thirty (30) days of when it first appears on your electronic transaction history will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.</p>
          <h4>34. Your Privacy.</h4>
          <p>Your privacy is very important to Square. Upon acceptance of this Agreement, you confirm that you have read, understood and accepted <a href="https://squareup.com/legal/privacy">Square’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

</p>
          <h4>50. Disputes.</h4>
          <p>If a dispute of any kind arises, we want to understand and address your concerns quickly and to your satisfaction. Please contact the <a href="https://squareup.com/help">Square Help Center</a> with any dispute. If we cannot resolve your concerns, we agree to an informal and inexpensive dispute resolution process requiring individual arbitration. “Disputes” between you and Square (“Square” includes its processors, suppliers or licensors (or their respective affiliates, agents, directors or employees)) are defined for the purposes of this Agreement to include any claim, controversy, or dispute (whether involving contract, tort, equitable, statutory, or any other legal theory) between you and Square including but not limited to any claims relating in any way to this Agreement (including its breach, termination, or interpretation), any other aspect of our relationship, Square advertising, and any use of Square software or services. “Disputes” also include any claims that arose before this Agreement and that may arise after termination of this Agreement.</p>
          <h4>51. Binding Individual Arbitration.</h4>
          <p>You and Square agree to arbitrate all Disputes. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE ONLY BE ON A INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED, AND YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST SQUARE. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced (but in no case shall there be a class arbitration). All Disputes shall be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association (www.adr.org) or JAMS (www.jamsadr.org) according to this provision and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum. Consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather than through arbitration. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies. If you are a consumer bringing a claim relating to personal, household, or family use, any arbitration hearing will occur within the county or parish where you reside. Otherwise, any arbitration hearing will occur in San Francisco, California, or another mutually agreeable location, or a location ordered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. For any Dispute, Square will pay all the arbitration fees. If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled to attorney’s fees, you may recover those fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where you are seeking relief, Square will not seek to have you pay its attorney’s fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and Square also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of Square services. Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases) will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in the City and County of San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California.</p>
          <h4>52. Governing Law.</h4>
          <p>This Agreement and any Dispute will be governed by California law and/or applicable federal law (including the Federal Arbitration Act) as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California, without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles that would require application of law of a different jurisdiction.</p>
          <h4>53. Limitation on Time to Initiate a Dispute.</h4>
          <p>Unless otherwise required by law, an action or proceeding by you relating to any Dispute must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues.</p>
          <h4>54. Right to Amend.</h4>
          <p>We have the right to change or add to the terms of this Agreement at any time, and to change, delete, discontinue, or impose conditions on any feature or aspect of the Services with notice that we in our sole discretion deem to be reasonable in the circumstances, including such notice on our website at squareup.com or any other website maintained or owned by us for the purposes of providing services in terms of this Agreement. Any use of the Services after our publication of any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of this Agreement as modified. However, any Dispute that arose before the modification shall be governed by the Agreement (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that was in place when the Dispute arose.</p>
          <h4>55. Assignment.</h4>
          <p>This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Square without restriction.</p>
          <h4>56. Third Party Services and Links to Other Web Sites.</h4>
          <p>You may be offered services, products and promotions provided by third parties and not by Square (“Third Party Services”). If you decide to use these Third Party Services you will be responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions associated with these services. You agree that Square is not responsible for the performance of these services. The Square website may contain links to third party websites as a convenience to you. The inclusion of any website link does imply an approval, endorsement, or recommendation by Square. You agree that you access any such website at your own risk, and that the site is not governed by the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement. Square expressly disclaims any liability for these websites. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our website to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies.</p>
          <h4>57. Other Provisions.</h4>
          <p>Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, these terms are a complete statement of the agreement between you and Square, and they describe the entire liability of Square and its vendors and suppliers (including processors) and your exclusive remedy with respect to your access and use of the Services. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any other Square agreement or policy, this Agreement shall prevail on the subject matter of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it shall be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. Headings are included for convenience only, and shall not be considered in interpreting this Agreement. The Agreement does not limit any rights that Square may have under trade secret, copyright, patent, or other laws. Square’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.</p>
          <h4>58. Survival.</h4>
          <p>In addition to any provision that is reasonably necessary to accomplish or enforce the purpose of this Agreement, the following sections of this Agreement survive and remain in effect in accordance with their terms upon the termination of this Agreement: 13, 15-20, 24, 25, 27-33, 35, 37, 38, 45-58.</p>
