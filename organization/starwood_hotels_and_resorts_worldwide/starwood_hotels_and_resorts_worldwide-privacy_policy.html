    <a href="https://www.starwoodhotels.com/gx/privacy_policy.html#top">Back to Top</a>
</p><h2>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT:</h2><a name="information">&nbsp;</a><p>Starwood collects information about our guests and visitors to our web sites
so that we can provide an experience that is responsive to our guests' and
visitors' needs. Information may be collected as part of: (i) fulfilling
reservation or information requests, (ii) purchasing products, (iii)
registering for program membership, (iv) submitting a job application, or (v)
responding to communications from us (e.g., surveys, promotional offers, or
reservation confirmations). We endeavor to collect information only with your
knowledge and with your permission if necessary. The types of personally
identifiable information that we collect may include your name, home, work and
e-mail addresses, telephone and fax numbers, credit card information, date of
birth, gender, and lifestyle information such as room preferences, leisure
activities, names and ages of children, and other information necessary to
fulfill special requests (e.g., health conditions that require special room
accommodations).</p><p>Starwood may also collect non-personally identifiable information about you,
such as your use of our web sites, communication preferences, travel habits,
aggregated data relative to your stays, and responses to promotional offers and
surveys.</p><p>
    <a href="https://www.starwoodhotels.com/gx/privacy_policy.html#top">Back to Top</a>
</p><h2>PURPOSE FOR COLLECTION, PROCESSING, AND DISCLOSURE:</h2><a name="purpose">&nbsp;</a><h3>Collection &amp; Use</h3><p>Starwood is fully committed to providing you with information about the
collection and use of personally identifiable information (PII) furnished by,
or collected from, visitors while using our web sites, products and services.
It is our practice not to ask you for information unless we need it or intend
to use it. Some of the primary purposes for collecting your PII are as
follows:</p><ul>
    <li>
        <p>providing services such as processing a transaction (e.g., making a
reservation, fulfilling a request for information, or completing a product
order)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>marketing and communications with you in relation to the products and
services offered by Starwood, our strategic marketing partners, and other
trusted third parties</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>performing market research via surveys to better serve your needs, improve
the effectiveness of our web sites, your hotel experience, our various types of
communications, advertising campaigns, and/or promotional activities</p>
    </li>
</ul><p>You will always be offered the choice not to submit your PII or to decide
what communications you want to receive from us. However, doing so may cause
certain transactions to become affected. For example, not providing a name will
prevent the processing of reservations.</p><p>
    <a href="https://www.starwoodhotels.com/gx/privacy_policy.html#top">Back to Top</a>
</p><h3>Processing and Disclosure</h3><p>In most cases, the information you provide is added to a local or global
database. In the course of processing your information, it may be necessary to
transfer your PII to Starwood's affiliates, properties within the Starwood
system and/or third party service providers located in the United States and
throughout the world for the purposes outlined within this Privacy Statement.
As a general practice, Starwood does not sell, rent, or give physical
possession of your PII to unaffiliated third parties outside the Starwood
system. Situations in which Starwood may disclose your information to others
include:</p><ul>
    <li>
        <p>when we have received your consent to do so</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>in situations where sharing or disclosing your information is required in
order to offer you products or services you desire (e.g., a vacation
package)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>when companies or services providers that perform business activities on
behalf of Starwood require such information (e.g., credit card processing,
customer support services, market research administration or database
management services)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>when a hotel or other property leaves the Starwood system and access to your
PII is necessary to facilitate business operations or meet contractual
obligations</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>in the event Starwood is merged or acquired by another company</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or obligations in accordance
with applicable law or court order</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>in case of emergency such as to safeguard the life, health, or property of
an individual</p>
    </li>
</ul><p>If information is shared as mentioned above, we seek to limit the scope of
information that is furnished to the amount necessary for the performance of
the specific function. Unless otherwise precluded by legal process, we require
third parties to protect your PII and abide by applicable privacy laws and
regulations.</p><p>
    <a href="https://www.starwoodhotels.com/gx/privacy_policy.html#top">Back to Top</a>
</p><h2>CONSENT:</h2><a name="consent">&nbsp;</a><p>As part of our commitment to keep you informed, we may mail, e-mail,
telephone, or contact you by other means to notify you of new Starwood products
and services, or upcoming Starwood special offers, events, enhancements, or
other relevant information that may be of interest to you.&nbsp; You may also
receive mailings or other communications from carefully selected third parties.
We always offer you the option to decline any or all of these communications by
following the directions included in our e-mails or other communications, or by
contacting Starwood directly.</p><p>If you are a Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) program member, you may also
change your communication choices by updating your e-mail preferences in your
individual membership profile.</p><p>We would like to keep all of our guests and visitors informed and equally
able to take advantage of the benefits offered by Starwood and its strategic
marketing partners. However, if you reside outside of the United States,
certain data privacy regulations may require us to obtain your permission
before we send you information that you have not requested from us.</p><p>In some cases your permission will be implied from the nature of the service
requested or transaction undertaken. For example, Starwood may collect and use
personally identifiable information that you volunteer, or behavioral data or
information collected in the aggregate. In addition, your permission will be
deemed given for communications from us that are necessary to fulfill
transactions and services that you request.</p><p>In certain circumstances, we will seek your express permission when we
collect information that is regarded under certain data privacy regulations to
be sensitive in nature (e.g., information revealing racial or ethnic origin,
political opinions, or health conditions).</p><p>
    <a href="https://www.starwoodhotels.com/gx/privacy_policy.html#top">Back to Top</a>
</p><h2>DATA TRANSFERS ACROSS INTERNATIONAL BORDERS:</h2><a name="data">&nbsp;</a><p>As a global company, we endeavor to provide you with the same outstanding
service in New York City, as you would find in Paris or Beijing. To achieve
this goal, we have established a global network comprised of properties,
offices, data centers, trusted marketing partners, service providers, customer
contact centers, and trained associates around the globe. The nature of our
business and our operations require us to transfer your information, including
personally identifiable information (PII), to other group companies,
properties, centers of operations, data centers, or service providers that may
be located in countries outside of your own.&nbsp;Although the data protection
and other laws of these various countries may not be as comprehensive as those
in your own country, Starwood will take appropriate steps to ensure that your
PII is protected and handled as described in this Privacy Statement. Japan
residents, please <a href="javascript:void window.open('http://www.starwood-japan.jp/privacy_e/','terms','width=800,height=600,screenX=150,screenY=150,top=150,left=150,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes');">

</p><h2>ACCESS TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION:</h2><a name="access">&nbsp;</a><p>To ensure that your personally identifiable information (PII) is accurate
and up to date, we encourage you to regularly review and update your
information as appropriate (e.g., in the event your home or e-mail address
changes, or you wish to add an additional method for us to communicate with
you). If you are a Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) program member, you can
review and update your individual membership profile on-line or with the
assistance of a Starwood customer service representative. If you are not a SPG
program member you can review and update your PII by contacting our Consumer
Affairs Privacy Office and requesting an access form. Please note that in an
effort to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of your PII, you may be asked to
provide proof of identity (or other authentication materials) together with the
completed access request form. Access to PII from non-SPG program members
cannot be provided by telephone.</p><p>If, upon review, you wish to deactivate your SPG program member profile, or
update your PII, we will endeavor to do so in a timely manner. Occasionally,
information that you request to be removed will be retained in certain files
for a period of time in order to properly resolve disputes or to troubleshoot
problems. In addition, some types of information may be stored indefinitely on
"back up" systems or within log files due to technical constraints, or
financial or legal requirements. Therefore, you should not always expect that
all of your PII will be completely removed from our databases in response to
your request.</p><p>

</p><h2>SECURITY SAFEGUARDS:</h2><a name="security">&nbsp;</a><p>Starwood recognizes the importance of information security, and is
constantly reviewing and enhancing our technical, physical, and logical
security rules and procedures.&nbsp;All Starwood owned web sites and servers
have security measures in place to help protect your personally identifiable
information against loss, misuse, and alteration while under our control.
Although "guaranteed security" does not exist either on or off the
Internet, we safeguard your information using both procedural and technical
safeguards, including password controls, "firewalls" and the use of up
to 128-bit encryption based on a Class 3 Digital Certificate issued by
VeriSign, Inc.&nbsp; This allows for the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an
encryption method used to help protect your data from interception and hacking
while in transit.</p><p>
    <a href="https://www.starwoodhotels.com/gx/privacy_policy.html#top">Back to Top</a>
</p><h2>ON-LINE TECHNOLOGIES:</h2><a name="technologies">&nbsp;</a><p>Starwood may use cookies, invisible pixels, and web beacons to obtain
information about you while visiting our web sites. A cookie is a very small
text file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your
computer's hard drive. It assigns the computer with a unique identifier, which
in turn, becomes your identification card whenever you return to a Starwood web
site.</p><p>Cookies are designed to save you time because they help us to provide you
with a customized experience without you having to remind us of your
preferences each time you return to our web pages. Starwood cookies are not
designed to damage your files, nor can they read information from other files
on your computer hard drive.</p><p>Cookies can also help us provide you with a personalized on-line experience
in the following ways:</p><ul>
    <li>
        <p>they remember your user name and password for future visits so log-in is
easier and faster</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>they ensure you are provided with the appropriate frames and content</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>they ensure you obtain all requested information</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>they help us deliver communications that are relevant and responsive to your
interests and location</p>
    </li>
</ul><p>Starwood cookies are limited to our web sites only, and are not designed to
follow you when traveling on the Internet after leaving Starwood owned web
sites. We track the usage of our web sites in order to better meet your needs
and to help make it easier for you to find information in the future. Please
note that in addition to Starwood cookies, various third parties may also place
cookies on your computer's hard drive. Starwood is not responsible for the
presence or absence of third party cookies, or for the technological
capabilities or practices employed by third parties in connection with third
party cookies.</p><p>If you would prefer not to have the benefits of cookies, your Internet
browser can be adjusted to treat cookies in different ways. Depending upon the
type of browser you are using, you may be able to configure your browser so
that: (i) you are prompted to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis
or (ii) you may be able to prevent your browser from accepting any cookies at
all. You should refer to the supplier or manufacturer of your web browser for
specific details about cookie security. However, you should also understand
that rejecting cookies might affect your ability to perform certain
transactions on our web sites and our ability to recognize your browser from
one visit to the next.</p><p>Starwood also uses invisible pixels, sometimes called web beacons, to count
how many people visit certain web pages. Information collected from invisible
pixels is used and reported in the aggregate and does not contain personally
identifiable information. Starwood may use this information to improve
marketing programs and content.</p><p>

</p><h2>LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES:</h2><a name="links">&nbsp;</a><p>In order to anticipate your needs, Starwood provides links to other web
sites for your convenience and information. Starwood is not responsible or
liable for any content presented by or contained on any independent web site,
including, but not limited to, any advertising claims or marketing practices.
Please note that while Starwood will protect your information on Starwood owned
and operated web sites, we cannot control and will not be responsible for the
privacy policies of third party web sites, including web sites owned or
controlled by independent franchisees, third party owners of hotel, resort,
interval ownership, or residence properties that may use the name of a Starwood
brand, or web sites not controlled or authorized by Starwood. Third party web
sites that are accessed through links on our web sites have separate privacy
and data collection practices, and security measures. We have no responsibility
or liability for the practices, policies and security measures implemented by
third parties on their web sites. We encourage you to contact them to ask
questions about their privacy practices, policies and security measures before
disclosing any personally identifiable information. We recommend that you
review the privacy statements and policies of linked web sites to understand
how those web sites collect, use and store information.</p><p>

identifiable information directly from minors; however, we cannot always
determine the age of persons who access and use our web sites. If a minor (as
defined by applicable law) provides us with his/her data without parental or
guardian consent, we encourage the parent or guardian to contact us to have
this information removed and to unsubscribe the minor from future Starwood
marketing communications.</p><p>
