        <p></p><h2>Special tax notice regarding plan distributions</h2><p></p>
        	<p>You are receiving this notice because all or a portion of a distribution you are receiving from your employer plan (the "Plan") may be eligible to be rolled over to an IRA or an employer plan. This notice is intended to help you decide whether to complete such a rollover.</p>
        	<p>Part I of this notice describes the rollover rules that apply to Plan distributions that are not from a designated Roth account (a type of account in some employer plans with special tax rules). Part II of this notice describes the rollover rules that apply to Plan distributions that are from a designated Roth account. The Plan administrator or Vanguard will tell you the amount that is being paid from each type of account.</p>
        	<p>Rules that apply to most payments from a plan are described in the <b>General information about rollovers</b> section. Special rules that only apply in certain circumstances are described in the Special rules and options section.</p>
        	<p></p><h2>For more information</h2><p></p>
        	<p>This notice summarizes only the federal (not state or local) tax rules that might apply to your payment. The following rules are complex and contain many conditions and exceptions that are not included in this notice. Therefore, you may want to consult with the Plan administrator or a professional tax advisor before you take a payment of your benefits from your Plan.</p>
        	<p>Also, you can find more detailed information on the federal tax treatment of payments from employer plans in: IRS Publication 575, Pension and Annuity Income; IRS Publication 590, Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs); and IRS Publication 571, Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans (403(b) Plans). These publications are available at local IRS offices, on the Web at www.irs.gov, or by calling <b>800-TAX-FORM</b>.</p>
        	<p></p><h2>Part I. Distributions not from a Roth account</h2><p></p>
        	<p></p><h2>General information about rollovers</h2><p></p>
        	<p><b>Q. How can a rollover affect my taxes?<br>A.</b> You will be taxed on a Plan payment if you do not roll it over. If you are under age 59½ and do not complete a rollover, you will also have to pay a 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions (unless an exception applies). However, if you complete a rollover, you will not have to pay tax until you receive payments later, and the 10% federal penalty tax will not apply if those payments are made after you are age 59½ (or earlier if an exception applies).</p>
        	<p><b>Q. Where may I direct a rollover?<br>A.</b> You may roll over the payment to either an IRA (an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity) or an employer plan (a tax-qualified plan, section 403(b) plan, or governmental section 457(b) plan) that will accept the rollover. The rules of the IRA or employer plan that holds the rollover will determine your investment options, fees, and rights to payment from the IRA or employer plan (for example, no spousal consent rules apply to IRAs and IRAs may not provide loans). Further, the amount rolled over will become subject to the tax rules that apply to the IRA or employer plan.</p>
        	<p><b>Q. How do I complete a rollover?<br>A.</b> There are two ways to complete a rollover. You can complete either a direct rollover or a 60-day rollover.</p><ul><li>With a direct rollover, the Plan will make the payment directly to your IRA or an employer plan. You should contact the IRA sponsor or the administrator of the employer plan for information on how to complete a direct rollover.</li><li>With a 60-day rollover, you can still complete a rollover by making a deposit into an IRA or eligible employer plan that will accept it. You will have 60 days after you receive the payment to make the deposit. If you do not complete a direct rollover, the Plan is required to withhold 20% of the payment for federal income taxes (up to the amount of cash and property received other than employer stock). This means that, in order to roll over the entire payment in a 60-day rollover, you must use other funds to make up for the 20% withheld. If you do not roll over the entire amount of the payment, the portion not rolled over will be taxed and will be subject to the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions if you are under age 59½ (unless an exception applies).</li></ul> <p></p>
        	<p><b>Q. How much may I roll over?<br>A.</b> If you wish to complete a rollover, you may roll over all or part of the amount eligible for rollover. Any payment from the Plan is eligible for rollover, except: </p><ul><li>Certain payments spread over a period of at least ten years or over your life or life expectancy (or the lives or joint life expectancy of you and your beneficiary).</li><li>Required minimum distributions after age 70½ (or after death).</li><li>Hardship distributions.</li><li>ESOP dividends.</li><li>Corrective distributions of contributions that exceed tax law limitations.</li><li>Loans treated as deemed distributions (for example, loans in default because of missed payments before your employment ends).</li><li>Cost of life insurance paid by the Plan.</li><li>Contributions made under special automatic enrollment rules that are withdrawn pursuant to your request within 90 days of enrollment.</li><li>Amounts treated as distributed because of a prohibited allocation of S corporation stock under an ESOP (also, there will generally be adverse tax consequences if you roll over a distribution of S corporation stock to an IRA).</li></ul>&nbsp; <p>The Plan administrator or the payor can tell you what portion of a payment is eligible for rollover.</p><p></p>
        	<p><b>Q. If I don't complete a rollover, will I have to pay the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions?<br>A.</b> If you are under age 59½, you will have to pay the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions for any payment from the Plan (including amounts withheld for income tax) that you do not roll over, unless one of the exceptions listed below applies. This tax is in addition to the regular income tax on the payment not rolled over.<br>The 10% federal penalty tax does not apply to the following payments from the Plan:</p><ul><li>Payments made after you separate from service if you will be at least age 55 in the year of the separation.</li><li>Payments that start after you separate from service if paid at least annually in equal or close to equal amounts over your life or life expectancy (or the lives or joint life expectancy of you and your beneficiary).</li><li>Payments from a governmental defined benefit pension plan made after you separate from service if you are a public safety employee and you are at least age 50 in the year of the separation.</li><li>Payments made because of disability.</li><li>Payments after your death.</li><li>Payments of ESOP dividends.</li><li>Corrective distributions of contributions that exceed tax law limitations.</li><li>Cost of life insurance paid by the Plan.</li><li>Contributions made under special automatic enrollment rules that are withdrawn pursuant to your request within 90 days of enrollment.</li><li>Payments made directly to the government to satisfy a federal tax levy.</li><li>Payments made under a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO).</li><li>Payments up to the amount of your deductible medical expenses.</li><li>Certain payments made while you are on active duty if you were a member of a reserve component called to duty after September 11, 2001, for more than 179 days.</li><li>Payments of certain automatic enrollment contributions requested to be withdrawn within 90 days of the first contribution.</li></ul> <p></p>
        	<p><b>Q. If I complete a rollover to an IRA, will the 10% federal penalty tax apply to early distributions from the IRA?<br>A.</b> If you receive a payment from an IRA and are under age 59½, you will have to pay the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions from the IRA, unless an exception applies. In general, the exceptions to the 10% federal penalty tax for early distributions from an IRA are the same as the exceptions listed above for early distributions from a plan. However, there are a few differences for payments from an IRA, including: </p><ul><li>There is no exception for payments after separation from service that are made after age 55.</li><li>The exception for qualified domestic relations orders (QDROs) does not apply (although a special rule applies under which, as part of a divorce or separation agreement, a tax-free transfer may be made directly to an IRA of a spouse or former spouse).</li><li>The exception for payments made at least annually in equal or close to equal amounts over a specified period applies without regard to whether you have had a separation from service.</li><li>There are additional exceptions for (1) payments for qualified higher education expenses, (2) payments up to $10,000 used in a qualified first-time home purchase, and (3) payments after you have received unemployment compensation for 12 consecutive weeks (or would have been eligible to receive unemployment compensation but for self-employed status)</li></ul><p></p>
        	<p></p><h2>Special rules and options</h2><p></p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if my payment includes after-tax contributions?<br>A.</b> After-tax contributions included in a payment are not taxed. If a payment is only part of your benefit, an allocable portion of your after-tax contributions is generally included in the payment. If you have pre-1987 after-tax contributions maintained in a separate account, a special rule may apply to determine whether the after-tax contributions are included in a payment.</p>
        	<p>You may roll over to an IRA a payment that includes after-tax contributions through either a direct rollover or a 60-day rollover. You must keep track of the aggregate amount of the after-tax contributions in all of your IRAs (in order to determine your taxable income for later payments from the IRAs). If you complete a 60-day rollover to an IRA of only a portion of the payment made to you, the after-tax contributions are treated as rolled over last.</p>
        	<p>For example, assume you are receiving a complete distribution of your benefit that totals $12,000, of which $2,000 is after-tax contributions. In this case, if you roll over $10,000 to an IRA in a 60-day rollover, no amount is taxable because the $2,000 amount not rolled over is treated as being aftertax contributions.</p>
        	<p>You may roll over to an employer plan all of a payment that includes after-tax contributions, but only through a direct rollover (and only if the receiving plan separately accounts for after-tax contributions and is not a governmental section 457(b) plan). You can complete a 60-day rollover to an employer plan of part of a payment that includes after-tax contributions, but only up to the amount of the payment that would be taxable if not rolled over.</p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if I miss the 60-day rollover deadline?<br>A.</b> Generally, the 60-day rollover deadline cannot be extended. However, the IRS has the limited authority to waive the deadline under certain extraordinary circumstances, such as when external events prevented you from completing the rollover by the 60-day rollover deadline. To apply for a waiver, you must file a private letter ruling request with the IRS. Private letter ruling requests require the payment of a nonrefundable user fee. For more information, see IRS Publication 590, Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).</p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if my payment includes employer stock that I do not roll over?<br>A.</b> If you do not complete a rollover, you can apply a special rule to payments of employer stock (or other employer securities) that are either attributable to after-tax contributions or paid in a lump sum after separation from service (or after age 59½, or as the result of the participant's disability or death). Under the special rule, the net unrealized appreciation on the stock will not be taxed when distributed from the Plan and will be taxed at capital gain rates when you sell the stock. Net unrealized appreciation is generally the increase in the value of employer stock after it was acquired by the Plan.</p>
        	<p>If you complete a rollover for a payment that includes employer stock (for example, by selling the stock and rolling over the proceeds within 60 days of the payment), the special rule relating to the distributed employer stock will not apply to any subsequent payments from the IRA or employer plan. Vanguard can tell you the amount of any net unrealized appreciation.</p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if I have an outstanding loan?<br>A.</b> If you have an outstanding loan from the Plan, your account balance may be reduced (or "offset") by the amount of the loan, typically when your employment ends. The remaining loan balance is treated as a distribution to you and will be subject to taxes (and the 10% federal penalty tax if you are under age 59½, unless an exception applies) unless you complete a 60-day rollover of such amount to an IRA or employer plan.</p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if I was born on or before January 1, 1936?<br>A.</b> If you were born on or before January 1, 1936, and receive a lump-sum distribution that you do not roll over, special rules for calculating the amount of the tax on the payment might apply to you. For more information, see IRS Publication 575, Pension and Annuity Income.</p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if my payment is from a governmental section 457(b) plan?<br>A.</b> If the Plan is a governmental section 457(b) plan, the same rules described elsewhere in this notice generally apply, allowing you to roll over the payment to an IRA or an employer plan that accepts rollovers. One difference is that, if you do not complete a rollover, you will not have to pay the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions from the Plan even if you are under age 59½ (unless the payment is from a separate account holding rollover contributions that were made to the Plan from a tax-qualified plan, a section 403(b) plan, or an IRA). However, if you complete a rollover to an IRA or to an employer plan that is not a governmental section 457(b) plan, a later distribution made before age 59½ will be subject to the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions (unless an exception applies).</p>
        	<p>Other differences are that you cannot complete a rollover if the payment is due to an "unforeseeable emergency" and the special rules under "If your payment includes employer stock that you do not roll over" and "If you were born on or before January 1, 1936" do not apply.</p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if I am an eligible retired public safety officer and my pension payment is used to pay for health coverage or qualified long-term care insurance?<br>A.</b> If the Plan is a governmental plan, you retired as a public safety officer, and your retirement was by reason of disability or was after normal retirement age, you can exclude from your taxable income plan payments paid directly as premiums to an accident or health plan (or a qualified long-term care insurance contract) that your employer maintains for you, your spouse, or your dependents, up to a maximum of $3,000 annually. For this purpose, a public safety officer is a law enforcement officer, firefighter, chaplain, or member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew.</p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if I roll over my payment to a Roth IRA?<br>A.</b> If you roll over the payment to a Roth IRA, a special rule applies under which the amount of the payment rolled over (reduced by any after-tax amounts) will be taxed. However, the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions will not apply (unless you take the amount rolled over out of the Roth IRA within five years, counting from January 1 of the year of the rollover). For payments from the Plan during 2010 that are rolled over to a Roth IRA, the taxable amount can be spread over a two-year period starting in 2011. If you roll over the payment to a Roth IRA, later payments from the Roth IRA that are qualified distributions will not be taxed (including earnings after the rollover).</p>
        	<p>A qualified distribution from a Roth IRA is a payment made after you are age 59½ (or after your death or disability, or as a qualified first-time homebuyer distribution of up to $10,000) and after you have had a Roth IRA for at least five years. In applying this five-year rule, you count from January 1 of the year for which your first contribution was made to a Roth IRA. Payments from the Roth IRA that are not qualified distributions will be taxed to the extent of earnings after the rollover, including the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions (unless an exception applies). You do not have to take required minimum distributions from a Roth IRA during your lifetime.</p>
        	<p>For more information, see IRS Publication 590, Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs). You may also be permitted to roll over a payment from the Plan to a designated Roth account in the Plan. For more information, see below.</p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if I roll over my payment to a designated Roth account in the Plan?<br>A.</b> You can roll over the payment to a designated Roth account in the Plan only if the Plan permits such rollovers. (You may contact Vanguard or your Plan administrator to see if this option is available under your Plan.) If you roll over the payment to a designated Roth account in the Plan, the amount of the payment rolled over (reduced by any after-tax amounts directly rolled over) will be taxed. However, the 10% additional tax on early distributions will not apply (unless you take the amount rolled over out of the designated Roth account within the 5-year period that begins on January 1 of the year of the rollover and you have not attained age 59½ at the time of the withdrawal). For payments from the Plan in 2010 that are rolled over to a designated Roth account in the Plan (and that are not distributed from that account until after 2011), the taxable amount of the rollover will be taxed half in 2011 and half in 2012, unless you elect to be taxed in 2010.</p>
        	<p>If you roll over the payment to a designated Roth account in the Plan, later payments from the designated Roth account that are qualified distributions will not be taxed (including earnings after the rollover). A qualified distribution from a designated Roth account is a payment made both after you attain age 59½ (or after your death or disability) and after you have had a designated Roth account in the Plan for a period of at least 5 years. The 5-year period described in the preceding sentence begins on January 1 of the year your first contribution was made to the designated Roth account. However, if you made a direct rollover to a designated Roth account in the Plan from a designated Roth account in a plan of another employer, the 5-year period begins on January 1 of the year your first contribution was made to the designated Roth account in the Plan or, if earlier, to the designated Roth account in the plan of the other employer. Payments from the designated Roth account that are not qualified distributions will be taxed to the extent allocable to earnings after the rollover, including the 10% additional tax on early distributions (unless an exception applies).</p>
        	<p>If your eligibility to take a distribution from the Plan is conditioned on a rollover to a designated Roth account in the Plan, the other distribution and rollover alternatives explained in this notice are not available for such distribution.</p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if I am not a Plan participant?<br>A.</b> If you receive a distribution after the participant's death that you do not roll over, the distribution will generally be taxed in the same manner described elsewhere in this notice. However, the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions and the special rules for public safety officers do not apply, and the special rule described under the section "If you were born on or before January 1, 1936" applies only if the participant was born on or before January 1, 1936.</p>
        	<p>If you receive a payment from the Plan as the surviving spouse of a deceased participant, you have the same rollover options that the participant would have had, as described elsewhere in this notice. In addition, if you choose to complete a rollover to an IRA, you may treat the IRA as your own or as an inherited IRA.</p>
        	<p>An IRA you treat as your own is treated like any other IRA of yours, so that payments made to you before you are age 59½ will be subject to the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions (unless an exception applies) and required minimum distributions from your IRA do not have to start until after you are age 70½.</p>
        	<p>If you treat the IRA as an inherited IRA, payments from the IRA will not be subject to the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions. However, if the participant had started taking required minimum distributions, you will have to receive required minimum distributions from the inherited IRA. If the participant had not started taking required minimum distributions from the Plan, you will not have to start receiving required minimum distributions from the inherited IRA until the year the participant would have been age 70½</p>
        	<p></p><ul><li>If you receive a payment from the Plan because of the participant's death and you are a designated beneficiary other than a surviving spouse, the only rollover option you have is to complete a direct rollover to an inherited IRA. Payments from the inherited IRA will not be subject to the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions. You will have to receive required minimum distributions from the inherited IRA.</li><li>If you are the spouse or former spouse of the participant who receives a payment from the Plan under a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO), you generally have the same options the participant would have (for example, you may roll over the payment to your own IRA or an eligible employer plan that will accept it). Payments under the QDRO will not be subject to the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions.</li></ul><p></p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if I am a nonresident alien?<br>A.</b> If you are a nonresident alien and you do not complete a direct rollover to a U.S. IRA or U.S. employer plan, instead of withholding 20%, the Plan is generally required to withhold 30% of the payment for federal income taxes. If the amount withheld exceeds the amount of tax you owe (as may happen if you complete a 60-day rollover), you may request an income tax refund by filing Form 1040NR and attaching your Form 1042-S. See Form W-8BEN for claiming that you are entitled to a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty. For more information, see also IRS Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens, and IRS Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities.</p>
        	<p><b>Q. Are there any other special rules?<br>A.</b> If a payment is one in a series of payments for a period of less than ten years, your choice whether to make a direct rollover will apply to all later payments in the series (unless you make a different choice for later payments).</p>
        	<p>If your payments for the year are less than $200 (not including payments from a designated Roth account in the Plan), the Plan is not required to allow you to complete a direct rollover and is not required to withhold for federal income taxes. However, you may complete a 60-day rollover.</p>
        	<p>Unless you elect otherwise, a mandatory cashout of more than $1,000 (not including payments from a designated Roth account in the Plan) will be directly rolled over to an IRA chosen by the Plan administrator or the payor. A mandatory cashout is a payment from a Plan to a participant made before age 62 (or normal retirement age, if later) and without consent, where the participant's benefit does not exceed $5,000 (not including any amounts held under the plan as a result of a prior rollover made to the Plan). You may have special rollover rights if you recently served in the U.S. Armed Forces. For more information, see IRS Publication 3, Armed Forces' Tax Guide.</p>
        	<p></p><h2>Part II. Distributions from a Roth account</h2><p></p>
        	<p>This part of the tax notice describes the rollover rules that apply to payments from the Plan that are from a designated Roth account. If you also receive a payment from the Plan that is not from a designated Roth account, refer to Part I of this notice for the rollover rules that apply to such payment. The Plan administrator or the payor will tell you the amount that is being paid from each account.</p>
        	<p>All or a portion of a distribution from your employer plan (the "Plan") may be eligible to be rolled over to a Roth IRA or designated Roth account in an employer plan. The following questions and answers are intended to help you decide whether to complete a rollover.</p>
        	<p>Rules that apply to most payments from a designated Roth account are described in the General information about rollovers (from a Roth account) section. Special rules that only apply in certain circumstances are described in the Special rules and options section.</p>
        	<p></p><h2>General information about rollovers (from a Roth account)</h2><p></p>
        	<p><b>Q. How can a rollover affect my taxes?<br>A.</b> After-tax contributions included in a payment from a designated Roth account are not taxed, but earnings might be taxed. The tax treatment of earnings included in the payment depends on whether the payment is a qualified distribution. If a payment is only part of your designated Roth account, the payment will include an allocable portion of the earnings in your designated Roth account.</p>
        	<p>If the payment from the Plan is not a qualified distribution and you do not complete a rollover to a Roth IRA or a designated Roth account in an employer plan, you will be taxed on the earnings in the payment.</p>
        	<p>If you are under age 59½ a 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions will also apply to the earnings (unless an exception applies). However, if you complete a rollover, you will not have to pay taxes currently on the earnings and you will not have to pay taxes later on payments that are qualified distributions.</p>
        	<p>If the payment from the Plan is a qualified distribution, you will not be taxed on any part of the payment even if you do not complete a rollover. If you complete a rollover, you will not be taxed on the amount you roll over and any earnings on the amount you roll over will not be taxed if paid later in a qualified distribution.</p>
        	<p>A qualified distribution from a designated Roth account in the Plan is a payment made after you are age 59½ (or after your death or disability) and after you have had a designated Roth account in the Plan for at least five years. In applying the five-year rule, you count from January 1 of the year your first contribution was made to the designated Roth account. However, if you did a direct rollover to a designated Roth account in the Plan from a designated Roth account in another employer plan, your participation will count from January 1 of the year your first contribution was made to the designated Roth account in the Plan or, if earlier, to the designated Roth account in the other employer plan.</p>
        	<p><b>Q. To where may I roll over the payment?<br>A.</b> You may roll over the payment to either a Roth IRA (a Roth individual retirement account or Roth individual retirement annuity) or a designated Roth account in an employer plan (a tax-qualified plan or section 403(b) plan) that will accept the rollover. The rules of the Roth IRA or employer plan that holds the rollover will determine your investment options, fees, and rights to payment from the Roth IRA or employer plan (for example, no spousal consent rules apply to Roth IRAs and Roth IRAs may not provide loans). Further, the amount rolled over will become subject to the tax rules that apply to the Roth IRA or the designated Roth account in the employer plan. In general, these tax rules are similar to those described elsewhere in this notice, but differences include:</p><ul><li>If you complete a rollover to a Roth IRA, all of your Roth IRAs will be considered for purposes of determining whether you have satisfied the five-year rule (counting from January 1 of the year for which your first contribution was made to any of your Roth IRAs).</li><li>If you complete a rollover to a Roth IRA, you will not be required to take a distribution from the Roth IRA during your lifetime and you must keep track of the aggregate amount of the after-tax contributions in all of your Roth IRAs (in order to determine your taxable income for later Roth IRA payments that are not qualified distributions).</li><li>Eligible rollover distributions from a Roth IRA can only be rolled over to another Roth IRA.</li></ul> <p></p>
        	<p><b>Q. How do I complete a rollover?<br>A.</b> There are two ways to complete a rollover. You can either complete a direct rollover or a 60-day rollover. </p><ul><li>With a direct rollover, the Plan will make the payment directly to your Roth IRA or designated Roth account in an employer plan. You should contact the Roth IRA sponsor or the administrator of the employer plan for information on how to complete a direct rollover.</li><li>With a 60-day rollover, you may still complete a rollover by making a deposit within 60 days into a Roth IRA, whether the payment is a qualified or nonqualified distribution. In addition, you can complete a rollover by making a deposit within 60 days into a designated Roth account in an employer plan if the payment is a nonqualified distribution and the rollover does not exceed the amount of the earnings in the payment. You cannot complete a 60-day rollover to an employer plan of any part of a qualified distribution. If you receive a distribution that is a nonqualified distribution and you do not roll over an amount at least equal to the earnings allocable to the distribution, you will be taxed on the amount of those earnings not rolled over, including the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions if you are under age 59½(unless an exception applies). If you do not complete a direct rollover and the payment is not a qualified distribution, the Plan is required to withhold 20% of the earnings for federal income taxes (up to the amount of cash and property received other than employer stock). This means that, in order to roll over the entire payment in a 60-day rollover to a Roth IRA, you must use other funds to make up for the 20% withheld.</li></ul><p></p>
        	<p><b>Q. How much may I roll over?<br>A.</b> If you wish to complete a rollover, you may roll over all or part of the amount eligible for rollover. Any payment from the Plan is eligible for rollover, except: </p><ul><li>Certain payments spread over a period of at least ten years or over your life or life expectancy (or the lives or joint life expectancy of you and your beneficiary).</li><li>Required minimum distributions after age 70½ (or after death).</li><li>Hardship distributions.</li><li>ESOP dividends.</li><li>Corrective distributions of contributions that exceed tax law limitations.</li><li>Loans treated as deemed distributions (for example, loans in default because of missed payments before your employment ends).</li><li>Cost of life insurance paid by the Plan.</li><li>Contributions made under special automatic enrollment rules that are withdrawn pursuant to your request within 90 days of enrollment.</li><li>Amounts treated as distributed because of a prohibited allocation of S corporation stock under an ESOP (also, there will generally be adverse tax consequences if S corporation stock is held by an IRA).</li></ul>The Plan administrator or the payor can tell you what portion of a payment is eligible for rollover.<p></p>
        	<p><b>Q. If I don't complete a rollover, will I have to pay the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions?<br>A.</b> If a payment is not a qualified distribution and you are under age 59½, you will have to pay the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions with respect to the earnings allocated to the payment that you do not roll over (including amounts withheld for income tax), unless one of the exceptions listed below applies. This tax is in addition to the regular income tax on the earnings not rolled over.</p>
        	<p>The 10% federal penalty tax does not apply to the following payments from the Plan:</p><ul><li>Payments made after you separate from service if you will be at least age 55 in the year of the separation.</li><li>Payments that start after you separate from service if paid at least annually in equal or close to equal amounts over your life or life expectancy (or the lives or joint life expectancy of you and your beneficiary).</li><li>Payments made because of disability.</li><li>Payments after your death.</li><li>Payments of ESOP dividends.</li><li>Corrective distributions of contributions that exceed tax law limitations.</li><li>Cost of life insurance paid by the Plan.</li><li>Contributions made under special automatic enrollment rules that are withdrawn pursuant to your request within 90 days of enrollment.</li><li>Payments made directly to the government to satisfy a federal tax levy.</li><li>Payments made under a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO).</li><li>Payments up to the amount of your deductible medical expenses.</li><li>Certain payments made while you are on active duty if you were a member of a reserve component called to duty after September 11, 2001, for more than 179 days.</li><li>Payments of certain automatic enrollment contributions requested to be withdrawn within 90 days of the first contribution.</li></ul><p></p>
        	<p><b>Q. If I complete a rollover to a Roth IRA, will the 10% federal penalty tax apply to early distributions from the IRA?<br>A.</b> If you receive a payment from a Roth IRA when you are under age 59½, you will have to pay the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions on the earnings paid from the Roth IRA, unless an exception applies or the payment is a qualified distribution. In general, the exceptions to the 10% federal penalty tax for early distributions from a Roth IRA listed above are the same as the exceptions for early distributions from a plan. However, there are a few differences for payments from a Roth IRA, including:</p><ul><li>There is no special exception for payments after separation from service.</li><li>The exception for qualified domestic relations orders (QDROs) does not apply (although a special rule applies under which, as part of a divorce or separation agreement, a tax-free transfer may be made directly to a Roth IRA of a spouse or former spouse).</li><li>The exception for payments made at least annually in equal or close to equal amounts over a specified period applies without regard to whether you have had a separation from service.</li><li>There are additional exceptions for (1) payments for qualified higher education expenses, (2) payments up to $10,000 used in a qualified first-time home purchase, and (3) payments after you have received unemployment compensation for 12 consecutive weeks (or would have been eligible to receive unemployment compensation but for self-employed status).</li></ul> <p></p>
        	<p></p><h2>Special rules and options</h2><p></p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if I miss the 60-day rollover deadline?<br>A.</b> Generally, the 60-day rollover deadline cannot be extended. However, the IRS has the limited authority to waive the deadline under certain extraordinary circumstances, such as when external events prevented you from completing the rollover by the 60-day rollover deadline. To apply for a waiver, you must file a private letter ruling request with the IRS. Private letter ruling requests require the payment of a nonrefundable user fee. For more information, see IRS Publication 590, Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).</p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if my payment includes employer stock that I do not roll over?<br>A.</b> If you receive a payment that is not a qualified distribution and you do not roll it over, you can apply a special rule to payments of employer stock (or other employer securities) that are paid in a lump sum after separation from service (or after age 59½, disability, or the participant's death). Under the special rule, the net unrealized appreciation on the stock included in the earnings in the payment will not be taxed when distributed to you from the Plan and will be taxed at capital gain rates when you sell the stock. If you complete a rollover to a Roth IRA for a nonqualified distribution that includes employer stock (for example, by selling the stock and rolling over the proceeds within 60 days of the distribution), you will not have any taxable income and the special rule relating to the distributed employer stock will not apply to any subsequent payments from the Roth IRA or employer plan. Net unrealized appreciation is generally the increase in the value of the employer stock after it was acquired by the Plan. The Plan administrator can tell you the amount of any net unrealized appreciation.</p>
        	<p>If you receive a payment that is a qualified distribution that includes employer stock and you do not roll it over, your basis in the stock (used to determine gain or loss when you later sell the stock) will equal the fair market value of the stock at the time of the payment from the Plan.</p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if I have an outstanding loan?<br>A.</b> If you have an outstanding loan from the Plan, your account balance may be reduced (or "offset") by the amount of the loan, typically when your employment ends. The loan offset amount is treated as a distribution to you at the time of the offset and, if the distribution is a nonqualified distribution, the earnings in the loan offset will be taxed (including the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions, unless an exception applies) unless you complete a 60-day rollover in the amount of the earnings in the loan offset to a Roth IRA or designated Roth account in an employer plan.</p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if I receive a nonqualified distribution and I was born on or before January 1, 1936?<br>A.</b> If you were born on or before January 1, 1936, and receive a lump-sum distribution that is not a qualified distribution and that you do not roll over, special rules for calculating the amount of the tax on the earnings in the payment might apply to you. For more information, see IRS Publication 575, Pension and Annuity Income.</p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if I receive a nonqualified distribution, am an eligible retired public safety officer, and my pension payment is used to pay for health coverage or qualified long-term care insurance?<br>A.</b> If the Plan is a governmental plan, you retired as a public safety officer, and your retirement was by reason of disability or was after normal retirement age, you can exclude from your taxable income nonqualified distributions paid directly as premiums to an accident or health plan (or a qualified long-term care insurance contract) that your employer maintains for you, your spouse, or your dependents, up to a maximum of $3,000 annually. For this purpose, a public safety officer is a law enforcement officer, firefighter, chaplain, or member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew.</p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if I am not a Plan participant?<br>A.</b> If you receive a distribution after the participant's death that you do not roll over, the distribution will generally be taxed in the same manner described elsewhere in this notice. However, whether the payment is a qualified distribution generally depends on when the participant first made a contribution to the designated Roth account in the Plan. Also, the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions and the special rules for public safety officers do not apply, and the special rule described under the section "If you receive a nonqualified distribution and you were born on or before January 1, 1936" applies only if the participant was born on or before January 1, 1936.</p>
        	<p>If you receive a payment from the Plan as the surviving spouse of a deceased participant, you have the same rollover options that the participant would have had, as described elsewhere in this notice. In addition, if you choose to complete a rollover to a Roth IRA, you may treat the Roth IRA as your own or as an inherited Roth IRA.</p>
        	<p>A Roth IRA that you treat as your own is treated like any other Roth IRA of yours, so that you will not have to receive any required minimum distributions during your lifetime and earnings paid to you in a nonqualified distribution before you are age 59½ will be subject to the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions (unless an exception applies). If you treat the Roth IRA as an inherited Roth IRA, payments from the Roth IRA will not be subject to the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions. An inherited Roth IRA is subject to required minimum distributions. If the participant had started taking required minimum distributions from the Plan, you will have to receive required minimum distributions from the inherited Roth IRA. If the participant had not started taking required minimum distributions, you will not have to start receiving required minimum distributions from the inherited Roth IRA until the year the participant would have been age 70½.</p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if I am a surviving beneficiary other than a spouse?<br>A.</b> If you receive a payment from the Plan because of the participant's death and you are a designated beneficiary other than a surviving spouse, the only rollover option you have is to complete a direct rollover to an inherited Roth IRA. Payments from the inherited Roth IRA, even if made in a nonqualified distribution, will not be subject to the 10% federal penalty tax on early distributions. You will have to receive required minimum distributions from the inherited Roth IRA.</p>
        	<p>Payments under a qualified domestic relations order. If you are the spouse or a former spouse of the participant who receives a payment from the Plan under a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO), you generally have the same options the participant would have (for example, you may roll over the payment as described in this notice).</p>
        	<p><b>Q. What if I am a nonresident alien?<br>A.</b> If you are a nonresident alien and you do not complete a direct rollover to a U.S. IRA or U.S. employer plan, instead of withholding 20%, the Plan is generally required to withhold 30% of the payment for federal income taxes. If the amount withheld exceeds the amount of tax you owe (as may happen if you complete a 60-day rollover), you may request an income tax refund by filing Form 1040NR and attaching your Form 1042-S. See Form W-8BEN for claiming that you are entitled to a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty. For more information, see also IRS Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens, and IRS Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities.</p>
        	<p></p><h2>Other special rules</h2><p></p>
        	<p>If a payment is one in a series of payments for a period of less than ten years, your choice whether to make a direct rollover will apply to all later payments in the series (unless you make a different choice for later payments).</p>
        	<p>If your payments for the year (only including payments from the designated Roth account in the Plan) are less than $200, the Plan is not required to allow you to complete a direct rollover and is not required to withhold for federal income taxes. However, you can complete a 60-day rollover.</p>
        	<p>Unless you elect otherwise, a mandatory cashout from the designated Roth account in the Plan of more than $1,000 will be directly rolled over to a Roth IRA chosen by the Plan administrator or the payor. A mandatory cashout is a payment from a plan to a participant made before age 62 (or normal retirement age, if later) and without consent, where the participant's benefit does not exceed $5,000 (not including any amounts held under the plan as a result of a prior rollover made to the plan).</p>
        	<p>You may have special rollover rights if you recently served in the U.S. Armed Forces. For more information, see IRS Publication 3, Armed Forces' Tax Guide.</p>

<h2 class="option1a">Notice of your right to defer</h2><span cid="comp-termSpecialTaxNoticeForm:NoticeToDeferHeading"></span></span>

    <p>The information in this notice is divided into two sections. The first section is for those still working, and the second is for those who have terminated service with their employer. Please disregard the information that does not apply to you.</p><h2>If you are still working</h2><p>If you are still working, you may be permitted to take an in-service withdrawal from the plan. An in-service withdrawal request is voluntary, and you have a right to defer taking a distribution in accordance with the terms of your plan. For more information regarding your in-service withdrawal options, as well as your distribution rights upon termination from employment, please refer to your plans Summary plan description (SPD), which you can obtain from your benefits office.</p><p>If you choose to take an in-service withdrawal, the investment options available outside of the plan may differ from the investment options available under the plan. Certain investment options under the plan may not be available outside of the plan. In addition, fees and expenses (including administrative fees or investment-related fees) outside the plan may differ from fees and expenses that apply to your account under the plan. For more information about the fees and expenses that apply to your account, call Vanguard Participant Services at <b><span id="gc-number-0" class="gc-cs-link" title="Call with Google Voice">800-523-1188</span></b> Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., Eastern time.</p><p>In general, in-service withdrawals that are not rolled over (or are not eligible to be rolled over) to an IRA or other eligible retirement plan are subject to taxes in the year of the withdrawal (except for the portion of the withdrawal, if any, that represents a return of Roth or traditional after-tax contributions). Amounts not rolled over may also be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59½ and will no longer be eligible for future tax-favored treatment of earnings. If you complete a rollover, the rollover amount will not be subject to taxes until you take distributions from the receiving plan or IRA. For more information about the potential tax consequences and your rollover options, please read the enclosed Special Tax Notice Regarding Plan Distributions.</p><p>You are permitted a minimum period of 30 days from the date you receive this notice to make a decision regarding your withdrawal. However, if you do not wish to wait until this 30-day period ends before taking a withdrawal, you may waive the notice period by making an affirmative withdrawal election.</p><h2>If you are a terminated participant</h2><p>If you have terminated service with your employer, you may be permitted to defer receipt of your benefit under the plan. If this option is available and you choose to defer the receipt of your benefit, the funds available for the investment of your account, including the fees associated with those funds, will remain the same, subject to the plan sponsors right to add or remove investment alternatives and the funds right to alter its fees.</p>
