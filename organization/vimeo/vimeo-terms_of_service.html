Annual subscribers to Vimeo Plus (as well as subscribers to multi-month subscriptions, should we make such subscription terms available) shall have thirty (30) days from the date of subscription to cancel their subscription for a full refund.  If monthly subscriptions are offered, monthly subscribers to Vimeo Plus shall have five (5) days from the date of subscription to cancel their subscription for a full refund.  After the cancellation period, purchases of Vimeo Plus subscriptions become FINAL and non-refundable, except in our sole and absolute discretion.  At that point, you cannot return or cancel your subscription for a refund, and if your account is cancelled or terminated by you or by us, for any reason, you will lose and forfeit the remaining time on your subscription.  The default setting for subscriptions is an annual, <em>auto-renewing</em> subscription.  This means that each year on your subscription anniversary date, you will be charged the prevailing rate for an additional one-year subscription renewal.  We may also offer shorter or longer term subscriptions (including monthly; multi-month – e.g., 3-month or 6-months at a time; or multi-year), which will also default to <em>auto-renew</em>.  If you have signed up for an automatically-renewing subscription, you will have the ability to cancel any future renewals.

	<p>Vimeo is used by a lot of great people.  Great people like to communicate and share thoughts and comments.

A "Forum" refers to a bulletin board, virtual community or other means for users to engage in public commentary or discussion, which may be found in various areas of the Vimeo Site, including within channels and groups.  You may make "comments" throughout the Vimeo Site, sharing your opinions about others' content or send messages to individual users, as applicable.  Channels, groups, comments and Forums are offered for, non-commercial use only.  You shall not, without VIMEO's express written approval, distribute or otherwise publish via any of the Services any material containing any solicitation of funds, promotion, advertising, or solicitation for goods or services.</p>
                <p>As with all Services, your privilege to create channels and groups, make comments and to participate in the Forums is dependent on your continued compliance with these Terms of Service, specifically including the COMMUNITY STANDARDS AND CONDUCT policy below.  VIMEO may revoke your privileges, terminate your registration/account or take any other measures deemed by VIMEO to be appropriate, in its sole discretion, to enforce these Terms of Service if violations are brought to our attention.  You agree that VIMEO may change, remove or replace any channel or group name for any reason.

	<p>YOU MADE ‘EM, YOU KEEP ‘EM. YOU OWN YOUR VIDEOS - ALWAYS.<br><br>In order for us to accept your videos and provide the Vimeo services (all while following the law), we need certain rights and licenses in and to your videos, including:<br><br>• Right to copy your video. Example: Vimeo content is stored and passed through multiple servers, and is served to multiple users on multiple machines to allow our site to be up and running globally. Each time we put your video on another server, , we are making a copy. This right lets us do that.<br><br>• Right to transmit, distribute &amp; perform your video. Example: to send your videos from server to server; to show your videos to one or more Vimeo users and to display your videos on vimeo.com (or other websites), these are the rights we need.<br><br>• Right to create derivative works and modify your video. Example: the Vimeo system works by transcoding the video files you upload so that they may be stored and served smoothly and properly each and every time. When we transcode your video, we are modifying it and making another version - or a "derivative" version. We also may need to resize the video when displaying it to users and are thereby 'modifying' it. These rights let us do that.<br><br>• Right to incorporate your video into other works. Example: the Vimeo site and player are also copyrighted and protected intellectual property. We incorporate your videos into the site and player. This right lets us do that.<br><br>You also grant Vimeo the right to use a portion of any video that has not been designated "private" for Vimeo mashups or other promotional purposes such as our Offline events or at conferences. Vimeo will not use your videos for other commercial purposes without your approval.<br><br>These rights and licenses are granted by you to us for free, so we can provide you with our services.<br><br>When you remove your content from Vimeo, these licenses to your videos terminate and we will no longer show them.<br><br>By placing content on Vimeo, you also give Vimeo users the right to view and use your content, as intended through the normal functionality of the website.

No video upload shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of VIMEO, and VIMEO shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any video.</p>
                <p><strong>When you remove or otherwise delete a video from the Services, the licenses granted by you to VIMEO and the Vimeo Site users shall terminate within a commercially reasonable time</strong>.

You agree that the Vimeo Site (and all Services) is deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over VIMEO or its respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers or shareholders, either specific or general, in any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.   You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these terms, or your use or non-use of the Services, shall be filed only in the state or federal courts located in New York County in the State of New York and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. You hereby irrevocably waive any right you may have to trial by jury in any such dispute, action or proceeding.</p>
                <p>These Terms of Service (and any further policies or documents incorporated by reference herein) constitute the entire understanding between VIMEO and users of the Vimeo Site and Services concerning the subject matter hereof and may not be modified except by revised Terms of Service posted by VIMEO.

If any of the provisions of these Terms of Service will contravene, or be invalid under, the laws of the particular jurisdiction where performed, such contravention or invalidity will not invalidate the whole agreement, rather these Terms of Service will be construed as if not containing the particular provision or provisions held invalid, and the rights and obligations of the parties will be construed and enforced accordingly.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the TOS does not modify, alter or amend any other specific agreement you have entered or will enter into with VIMEO.  To the extent that any provision of the TOS, or any supplemental agreement offered as any part of any registration for additional services on the Vimeo Site or within the Services, conflicts with any provision of your other agreements with VIMEO, the terms and conditions of such other agreement shall, take precedence over the conflicting term(s) and conditions of this TOS, unless otherwise expressly provided in such other agreement.</p>
                <p>No failure or delay by VIMEO in exercising any right or privilege under these Terms of Service will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or privilege under these Terms of Service.  If any provision of these Terms of Service shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
