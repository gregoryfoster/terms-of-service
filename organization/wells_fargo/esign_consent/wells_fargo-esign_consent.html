<h2>ESIGN CONSENT TO USE ELECTRONIC RECORDS AND SIGNATURES</h2>
<p>As part of your relationship with us, we want to ensure you have all of the 
information you need to effectively manage your accounts. Our goal is to provide 
you with as many options as possible for receiving your account documents. We 
are required by law to give you certain information "in writing" – which means 
you are entitled to receive it on paper. We may provide this information to you 
electronically, instead, with your prior consent. We also need your general 
consent to use electronic records and signatures in our relationship with you. 
So, before you use our Electronic Services you must review and consent to the 
terms outlined below.</p>
<p>In this consent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"We," "us," "our" and "Wells Fargo" means Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells 
  Fargo Advisors, and each and every current and future affiliate of Wells Fargo 
  &amp; Company. 
  </li><li>"You" and "your" means the person giving this consent, and also each 
  additional account owner, authorized signer, authorized representative, 
  delegate, product owner and/or service user identified on any Wells Fargo 
  Product that you apply for, use or access. 
  </li><li>"Communications" means each disclosure, notice, agreement, fee schedule, 
  statement, record, document, and other information we provide to you, or that 
  you sign or submit or agree to at our request. 
  </li><li>"Electronic Service" means each and every product and service we offer 
  that you apply for, use, administer or access using the Internet, a website, 
  email, messaging services (including text messaging) and/or software 
  applications (including applications for mobile or hand-held devices), either 
  now or in the future. 
  </li><li>"Wells Fargo Product" means each and every account, product or service we 
  offer that you apply for, own, use, administer or access, either now or in the 
  future. Wells Fargo Products include Electronic Services. 
  </li><li>The words "include" and "including," when used at the beginning of a list 
  of one or more items, indicates that the list contains examples – the list is 
  not exclusive or exhaustive, and the items in the list are only illustrations. 
  They are not the only possible items that could appear in the list. </li></ul>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Your consent to use electronic records and signatures; Choosing to 
  receive Communications electronically or in writing; Certain information must 
  still be provided in writing.</strong> In our sole discretion, the 
  Communications we provide to you, or that you sign or agree to at our request, 
  may be in electronic form ("Electronic Records"). <a href="https://online.wellsfargo.com/das/cgi-bin/session.cgi?sessargs=7RuC7P9Viimoo-ngB0B7TSqIKmufWx-j#examples">View additional examples of types of Communications that we may send as Electronic 
  Records under this consent.</a> We may also use electronic signatures and 
  obtain them from you as part of our transactions with you.</p>
  <p>Electronic Records may be delivered to you in a variety of ways. These 
  various delivery methods are described in our Online Access Agreement and in 
  other agreements we may have with you from time to time. In some cases, you 
  will be able to choose whether to receive certain Communications 
  electronically, or on paper, or both. We will provide you with instructions on 
  how to make those choices when they are available.</p>
  <p>We may always, in our sole discretion, provide you with any Communication 
  in writing, even if you have chosen to receive it electronically.</p>
  <p>Sometimes the law, or our agreement with you, requires you to give us a 
  written notice. You must still provide these notices to us on paper, unless we 
  specifically tell you in another Communication how you may deliver that notice 
  to us electronically.</p>
  <p>There are certain Communications that by law we are not permitted to 
  deliver to you electronically, even with your consent. So long as required by 
  law, we will continue to deliver those Communications to you in writing. 
  However, if the law changes in the future and permits any of those 
  Communications to be delivered as Electronic Records, this consent will 
  automatically cover those Communications as well.</p>
  <p>We will continue to provide your tax statements on paper unless you 
  separately elect to receive them electronically (if available).</p>
  </li><li>
  <p><strong>Your option to receive paper copies.</strong> If we provide 
  Electronic Records to you, and you want a paper copy, you may contact the 
  appropriate customer service unit and request a paper version. You will find 
  the appropriate contact information in the account statement or agreement for 
  the Wells Fargo Product related to the Electronic Record. You may have to pay 
  a fee for the paper copy unless charging a fee is prohibited by applicable 
  law. Please refer to the applicable agreement for any fee that may apply for 
  paper copies.</p>
  </li><li>
  <p><strong>Your consent covers all Wells Fargo Products; Privacy 
  Policies.</strong> Your consent covers all Communications relating to any 
  Wells Fargo Product. Your consent remains in effect until you give us notice 
  that you are withdrawing it.</p>
  <p>From time to time, you may seek to obtain a new Wells Fargo Product from 
  us. When you do, we may remind you that you have already given us your consent 
  to use Electronic Records and signatures. If you decide not to use Electronic 
  Records and signatures in connection with the new product or service, your 
  decision does not mean you have withdrawn this consent for any other Wells 
  Fargo Product.</p>
  <p>You agree that we may satisfy our obligation to provide you with an annual 
  copy of our Privacy Policy by keeping it available for review on www.wellsfargo.com, or, with 
  prior notice to you, on another website where we offer Electronic 
Services.</p>
  </li><li>
  <p><strong>You may withdraw your consent at any time; Consequences of 
  withdrawing consent; How to give notice of withdrawal.</strong> You have the 
  right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please be aware, however, that 
  withdrawal of consent may result in the termination of:</p>
  <ul class="withdisc">
    <li>your access to our Electronic Services, including online banking, and 
    </li><li>your ability to use certain Wells Fargo Products. </li></ul>
  <p>Your withdrawal of consent will become effective after we have had a 
  reasonable opportunity to act upon it.</p>
  <p>If you are receiving online account statements, the termination will cause 
  paper statements to be mailed to you via the U.S. Postal Service or other 
  courier. Depending on the specific Wells Fargo Product, if you withdraw 
  consent we may charge higher or additional fees for that product or for 
  services related to it. Please refer to the applicable agreement for any fee 
  that may apply.</p>
  <p>To withdraw your consent:</p>
  <ul class="withdisc">
    <li>If you are enrolled in online banking, you must contact us at 
    1-800-956-4442. 
    </li><li>If you are not enrolled in online banking, you must contact us at 
    1-800-869-3557. </li></ul>
  </li><li>
  <p><strong>You must keep your email or electronic address current with 
  us.</strong> You must promptly notify us of any change in your email or other 
  electronic address. You may change the email address on record for you by 
  going to the Account Services page within your online service and updating 
  your contact information. If you have given us another type of electronic 
  address, such as an electronic address or mobile phone number for SMS text 
  messages, you may change that address by going to the account management page 
  for each Wells Fargo Product you have linked to that address. There may be 
  other, special Wells Fargo Products for which we provide separate instructions 
  to update your email or other electronic address.</p>
  </li><li>
  <p><strong>Hardware and software you will need.</strong> To receive Electronic 
  Records, you must have access to: </p>
  <ul class="withdisc">
    <li>a Current Version (defined below) of an Internet browser we support, 
    </li><li>a connection to the Internet, 
    </li><li>a Current Version of a program that accurately reads and displays PDF 
    files (such as Adobe Acrobat Reader), and 
    </li><li>a computer and an operating system capable of supporting all of the 
    above. You will also need a printer if you wish to print out and retain 
    records on paper, and electronic storage if you wish to retain records in 
    electronic form. </li></ul>
  <p>You must also have an active email address.</p>
  <p>In some cases, you may also need a specific brand or type of device that 
  can support a particular software application, including an application 
  intended for particular mobile or handheld devices.</p>
  <p>By "Current Version," we mean a version of the software that is currently 
  being supported by its publisher. The following link includes more information 
  on the browsers we currently support and related system requirements: <a href="http://www.wellsfargo.com/help/wfonline/hardware_software_req.jhtml">Technical 
  Requirements</a>. (Note: If you click on the Technical Requirements link, be 
  sure to come back to this page to finish reading this ESIGN Consent.)</p>
  <p>You should check the Technical Requirements page occasionally for updates 
  on supported software. From time to time, we may offer services or features 
  that require that your Internet browser be configured in a particular way, 
  such as permitting the use of JavaScript or cookies. If we detect that your 
  Internet browser is not properly configured, we will provide you with a notice 
  and advice on how to update your configuration.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to discontinue support of a Current Version of 
  software if, in our sole opinion, it suffers from a security flaw or other 
  flaw that makes it unsuitable for use with Online Banking.</p>
  </li><li>
  <p><strong>Changes to hardware or software requirements.</strong> If our 
  hardware or software requirements change, and that change would create a 
  material risk that you would not be able to access or retain your Electronic 
  Records, we will give you notice of the revised hardware or software 
  requirements. Continuing to use Electronic Services after receiving notice of 
  the change is reaffirmation of your consent.</p>
  </li><li>
  <p><strong>Your enrollment in Electronic Services using our 
  equipment.</strong> If you enroll for an Electronic Service through one of our 
  customer service representatives or using our equipment, your enrollment may 
  not be complete until you take additional action. We will advise you, at the 
  time of your enrollment, of any additional action you must take. If you take 
  the required action, it is an affirmation of your consent to use electronic 
  records and signatures under the terms of this ESIGN Consent.</p>
  </li><li>
  <p><strong>Communications in languages other than English.</strong> Please 
  note, we may be unable to fulfill and service Wells Fargo Products in a 
  language other than English. Future Communications may be in English only. If 
  you are not fluent in English, you should consider obtaining the services of 
  an interpreter or taking other steps to ensure you understand the transaction 
  before entering into it and to explain any future Communications in 
  English.</p>
  <p>Please indicate your consent to use electronic records and signatures by 
  clicking on the "I Accept" button below. By providing your consent, you are 
  also confirming that you have the hardware and software described above, that 
  you are able to receive and review electronic records, and that you have an 
  active email account. You are also confirming that you are authorized to, and 
  do, consent on behalf of all the other account owners, authorized signers, 
  authorized representatives, delegates, product owners and/or service users 
  identified with your Wells Fargo Products.</p></li></ol><a name="examples"></a>
