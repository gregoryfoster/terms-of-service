            <h2 class="Subheading2">With whom we share Information</h2>
            <p>We   may need to disclose Personal Information to our affiliates, service   providers and business partners solely for the purpose of providing Zoho   Services to you. In such cases Zoho will also ensure that such   affiliates, service providers and business partners comply with this   Privacy Policy Statement and adopt appropriate confidentiality and   security measures. We will obtain your prior specific consent before we   share or disclose your Personal Information to any person outside Zoho   for any purpose that is not directly connected with providing Zoho   Services to you. We may share generic aggregated demographic information   not linked to any Personal Information regarding visitors and users   with our business partners and advertisers. Please   be aware that laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate may   obligate us to disclose user information and the contents of your user   account to the local law enforcement authorities under a legal process   or an enforceable government request. In   addition, we may also disclose Personal Information and contents of   your user account to law enforcement authorities if such disclosure is   determined to be necessary by Zoho in our sole and absolute discretion   for protecting the safety of our users, employees, or the general   public.</p>

            <h2 class="Subheading2"><strong>How secure is your   Information</strong></h2>

Access to   your name and email address is restricted to our employees who need to   know such information in connection with providing Zoho Services to you   and are bound by confidentiality obligations.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2 class="Subheading2"><strong>Your Choice in   Information Use</strong></h2>
            <p>You   will be required to register for our Zoho Services by providing   Personal Information. If you choose not to provide your Personal   Information, we will be unable to provide you the Zoho Services. We do   provide you with the option of not choosing a secret question and the   answer to it; however, we may not be able to reset your password for   you. We also provide you with the option of opting out from receiving   mail from us; however, you will not be able to receive email   notifications of new services, releases, upcoming events and changes to   the Privacy Policy Statement should you decide to opt-out of receiving   all messages from Zoho. In the event we decide to use your Personal   Information for any purpose other than as stated in this Privacy Policy   Statement, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of   your Personal Information for those other purposes. You may opt out of   receiving newsletters and other secondary messages from Zoho by   selecting the ‘unsubscribe’ function present in every message we send.</p>

            <p>We   may need to provide access to your Personal Information and the   contents of your user account to our employees and service providers for   the purpose of investigating any suspected illegal activity or   potential violation of the terms and conditions for use of Zoho   Services. However, Zoho will ensure that such access is in compliance   with this Privacy Policy Statement and subject to appropriate   confidentiality and security measures.</p>

            <p>Any   changes to the Privacy Policy Statement will be posted on our website   in order to keep you informed of any changes in nature of information   collected, manner of collection, use and sharing of information. If at   any point we decide to use Personal Information in a manner different   from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by   email and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses   unless you have opted out from receiving all email notifications from   us.

            <p>We   provide the capacity for users to post information in blogs and forums   for sharing information in a public space on the website. This   information is publicly available to all users of these forums and   visitors to Zoho. We require registration to publish information, but   given the public nature of both platforms, any Personal Information   disclosed within these forums may be used to contact users with   unsolicited messages. We encourage users to be cautious in disclosure of   Personal Information in public forums as Zoho is not responsible for   the Personal Information users elect to disclose.</p>
            <p>Zoho   also supports third party widgets on the website that allow users to   share articles and other information on different platforms. These   widgets do not collect or store any Personal Information from users on   the website and simply act as a bridge for your convenience in sharing   information.</p>
