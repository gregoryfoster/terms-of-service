            <p>THIS IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU OR  THE ENTITY THAT YOU REPRESENT (hereinafter “You” or “Your”) AND ZOHO   CORPORATION  (hereinafter “Zoho”) GOVERNING YOUR USE OF ZOHO SUITE OF ONLINE BUSINESS  PRODUCTIVITY AND COLLABORATION SOFTWARE (hereinafter “Zoho Service(s)”).   &nbsp;</p>
            <h2><strong>Parts  of   this Agreement</strong></h2>
            <p>This  Agreement consists of the following terms and conditions (hereinafter   the “General  Terms”) and terms and conditions, if any, specific to use of individual  Services (hereinafter the “Service Specific Terms”). The General Terms   and  Service Specific Terms are collectively referred to as the “Terms”. In   the  event of a conflict between the General Terms and Service Specific   Terms, the  Service Specific Terms shall prevail.</p>
            <h2><strong>Acceptance  of   the Terms</strong></h2>
            <p>You  must be of legal age to enter into a binding agreement in order to   accept the  Terms. If you do not agree to the General Terms, do not use any of   our Services. If  you agree to the General Terms and do not agree to any Service Specific   Terms,  do not use the corresponding Service. You can accept the Terms by   checking a  checkbox or clicking on a button indicating your acceptance of the terms   or by actually  using the Services.</p>
            <h2><strong>Description  of   Service</strong></h2>
            <p>We provide an array of services for  online collaboration and management including word processor,   spreadsheet,  presentation tool, database application creator, email client, chat   client,  organizer, customer relationship management application and project   management  application ("Service" or "Services"). You may use the  Services for your personal and business use or for internal business   purpose in  the organization that you represent. You may connect to the Services   using any  Internet browser supported by the Services. You are responsible for   obtaining  access to the Internet and the equipments necessary to use the Services.   You  can create and edit content with your user account and if you choose to   do so,  you can publish and share such content.</p>
            <h2><strong>Subscription  to   Beta Service</strong></h2>
            <p>We may offer certain Services as  closed or open beta services ("Beta Service" or “Beta Services”) for  the purpose of testing and evaluation. You agree that we have the sole  authority and discretion to determine the period of time for testing and   evaluation  of Beta Services. We will be the sole judge of the success of such   testing and  the decision, if any, to offer the Beta Services as commercial services.   You  will be under no obligation to acquire a subscription to use any paid   Service  as a result of your subscription to any Beta Service. We reserve the   right to  fully or partially discontinue, at any time and from time to time,   temporarily  or permanently, any of the Beta Services with or without notice to you.   You  agree that Zoho will not be liable to you or to any third party for any   harm  related to, arising out of, or caused by the modification, suspension or  discontinuance of any of the Beta Services for any reason.</p>
            <h2><strong>Modification  of   Terms of Service</strong></h2>
            <p>We may modify the Terms upon notice  to you at any time. You will be provided notice of any such modification   by  electronic mail or by publishing the changes on the website <a href="http://zoho.com/terms.html">http://zoho.com/terms.html</a>.  You may terminate your use of the Services if the Terms are modified in a  manner that substantially affects your rights in connection with use of   the  Services. Your continued use of the Service after notice of any change   to the  Terms will be deemed to be your agreement to the amended Terms.</p>
            <h2><strong>User  Sign   up Obligations</strong></h2>
            <p>You need to sign up for a user  account by providing all required information in order to access or use   the  Services. If you represent an organization and wish to use the Services   for corporate  internal use, we recommend that you, and all other users from your   organization,  sign up for user accounts by providing your corporate contact   information. In  particular, we recommend that you use your corporate email address. You   agree  to: a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about   yourself  as prompted by the sign up process; and b) maintain and promptly update   the  information provided during sign up to keep it true, accurate, current,   and  complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate,   outdated,  or incomplete, or if Zoho has reasonable grounds to suspect that such  information is untrue, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete, Zoho may   terminate  your user account and refuse current or future use of any or all of the  Services.</p>
            <h2><strong>Personal  Information   and Privacy</strong></h2>
            <p>Personal information you provide to  Zoho through the Service is governed by <a href="http://www.zoho.com/privacy.html">Zoho Privacy  Policy</a>.   Your election to use the Service indicates your acceptance  of the terms of the <a href="http://www.zoho.com/privacy.html">Zoho Privacy Policy</a>. You are responsible for  maintaining confidentiality of your username, password and other   sensitive  information. You are responsible for all activities that occur in your   user  account and you agree to inform us immediately of any unauthorized use   of your user  account by email to <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">document.writeln(unescape('%3C%61%20%68%72%65%66%3D%22%6D%61%69%6C%74%6F%3A%61%63%63%6F%75%6E%74%73%40%7A%6F%68%6F%63%6F%72%70%2E%63%6F%6D%22%3E%61%63%63%6F%75%6E%74%73%40%7A%6F%68%6F%63%6F%72%70%2E%63%6F%6D%3C%2F%61%3E'))</script><a href="mailto:accounts@zohocorp.com">accounts@zohocorp.com</a>

We are not  responsible for any loss or damage to you or to any third party incurred   as a  result of any unauthorized access and/or use of your user account, or  otherwise.</p>
            <h2><strong>Communications  from   Zoho</strong></h2>
            <p>The Service may include certain  communications from Zoho, such as service announcements, administrative  messages and newsletters. You understand that these communications shall   be  considered part of using the Services. As part of our policy to provide   you  total privacy, we also provide you the option of opting out from   receiving newsletters  from us. However, you will not be able to opt-out from receiving service  announcements and administrative messages.</p>
            <h2><strong>Fees  and   Payments</strong></h2>
            <p>Subscriptions to paid Services are  available on monthly and yearly subscription plans. Your subscription   will be  automatically renewed at the end of each subscription period unless you   inform  us that you do not wish to renew the subscription. The subscription fee   will be  charged to the Credit Card last used by you. If you would like the   payment for  the renewal to be made through a different Credit Card or if you do not   wish to  renew the subscription, you agree to inform us at least seven days prior   to the  renewal date. In the event of termination of the subscription, you will   be  refunded the subscription fee for the unused portion of the subscription  period. Zoho reserves the right to change the subscription fee and to   charge  for use of Services that are currently available free of charge. You   will not  be charged for using any Service unless you have opted for a paid   subscription  plan. Information on the subscription options and charges for all paid   Services  is available at <a href="http://www.zoho.com/pricing.html">PRICING</a>.</p>
            <h2><strong>Restrictions  on   Use</strong></h2>
            <p>In addition to all other terms and  conditions of this Agreement, you shall not: (i) transfer or otherwise   make  available to any third party the Services; (ii) provide any service   based on  the Services without prior written permission; (iii) use the third party   links  to sites without agreeing to their website terms &amp; conditions; (iv)   post  links to third party sites or use their logo, company name, etc. without   their  prior written permission; or (v) use the Services for spamming and other  illegal purposes.</p>
            <h2><strong>Spamming  and   Illegal Activities</strong></h2>
            <p>You agree to be solely responsible  for the contents of your transmissions through the Services. You agree   not to  use the Services for illegal purposes or for the transmission of   material that  is unlawful, defamatory, harassing, libelous, invasive of another's   privacy,  abusive, threatening, harmful, vulgar, pornographic, obscene, or is   otherwise  objectionable, offends religious sentiments, promotes racism, contains   viruses,  or that which infringes or may infringe intellectual property or other   rights  of another. You agree not to use the Services for the transmission of  "junk mail", "spam", "chain letters", “phishing”  or unsolicited mass distribution of email. We reserve the right to   terminate  your access to the Services if there are reasonable grounds to believe   that you  have used the Services for any illegal or unauthorized activity.</p>
            <h2><strong>Inactive  User   Accounts Policy</strong></h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to terminate  unpaid user accounts that are inactive for a continuous period of 120   days. In  the event of such termination, all data associated with such user   account will  be deleted. We will provide you prior notice of such termination and   backup of  your data by email. The data deletion policy may be implemented with   respect to  any or all of the Services. Each Service will be considered an   independent and  separate service for the purpose of calculating the period of   inactivity. In  other words, activity in one of the Services is not sufficient to keep   your user  account in another Service active. In case of accounts with more than   one user,  if at least one of the users is active, the account will not be   considered  inactive.</p>
            <h2><strong>Data  Ownership</strong></h2>
            <p>We respect your right to ownership  of content created or stored by you. You own the content created or   stored by  you. Unless specifically permitted by you, your use of the Services does   not  grant Zoho the license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or   distribute  the content created by you or stored in your user account for Zoho’s  commercial, marketing or any similar purpose. But you grant Zoho   permission to  access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat, publicly display   and  publicly perform the content of your user account solely as required for   the  purpose of providing the Services to you.</p>
            <h2><strong>User  Generated   Content</strong></h2>
            <p>You may transmit or publish content  created by you using any of the Services or otherwise. However, you   shall be  solely responsible for such content and the consequences of its   transmission or  publication.
